# Risks & Safeguards

Owner: Miron Krokhmal

---

- **Safety**: clear boundaries (not clinical advice), escalation resources, content moderation.
- **IP**: license enforcement for digital decks, watermarking, rate limits via SDK.
- **Model drift/bias**: evaluate prompts across cultures/languages; human-in-the-loop approvals.
- **Adoption friction**: offline mode & “no recording” mode so facilitators can still use Studio without data capture.
