- ❌ **No Offline Sync**: No mechanism to sync when connection is restored
- ❌ **No Offline Indicators**: Basic UI shows offline status but no offline functionality

### **Required Dependencies for Offline Support**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "idb": "^7.1.1",
    "workbox-webpack-plugin": "^7.0.0",
    "react-idb": "^1.0.0",
    "dexie": "^3.2.4"
  }
}
```

### **Critical Offline Features Missing**
1. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Service worker, manifest, offline caching
