5. **Optional**: Images if applicable

### Don't Worry About

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Choose Your Content Type

**Ask yourself**: What am I creating?

| If you're creating... | Use this template |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| A photo card with a concept/theme | `Core_ThematicCard_Template.md` |
| A story, quote, or reflection | `Core_ContentItem_Template.md` |
| A question to ask participants | `Tools_QuestionCard_Template.md` |
| A single word for reflection | `Tools_WordCard_Template.md` |
| An activity or exercise | `Core_JourneyElement_Template.md` |
| A complete training session | `Training_Template_Template.md` |
| A canvas layout/structure | `Canvas_Template_Template.md` |
| A facilitation technique | `Trainer_FacilitationTool_Template.md` |
| Something quick and simple | `QUICK_SUBMISSION_FORM.md` |

**Not sure?** Use the `QUICK_SUBMISSION_FORM.md` and we'll help you!

---

### Step 2: Open the Template

1. **Find the template file** in the `Content_Templates` folder
2. **Make a copy** - Don't edit the original template
3. **Rename your copy** - Use a meaningful name like "MyNewCard_ThematicCard.md"
4. **Open in any text editor** - Notepad, Word, Google Docs, anything works!

---

### Step 3: Fill Out the Template

**Tips for filling out templates**:

✅ **DO**:
- Fill in every field marked with * (required)
- Write naturally, as you would speak
- Provide as much detail as helpful
- Include examples when possible
- Add notes about how you'd use it
- Mention any cultural considerations
- Translate if you can (all 5 languages ideal)

❌ **DON'T**:
- Leave required fields blank
- Worry about perfect formatting
- Use technical jargon
- Stress about exact wording
- Skip the cultural notes
- Forget to add your name and contact info

---

### Step 4: Check Your Work

Use this quick checklist:

- [ ] All fields with * are completed
- [ ] I've provided a clear title
- [ ] The description explains what it is
- [ ] I've explained how/when to use it
- [ ] I've noted who it's for
- [ ] I've included cultural considerations
- [ ] My contact information is there
- [ ] I've attached any images (if needed)
- [ ] I've read through it once for errors

---

### Step 5: Submit

**Email your completed template to**: content@pointsofyou.com

**Email subject line**: 
"New Content: [Content Type] - [Your Name]"

**Example**: "New Content: Thematic Card - Sarah Johnson"

**Attach**:
- Your filled-out template
- Any images or supporting files

## Tips for Great Content

### For Stories and Quotes

✅ **Good Example**:
"A Zen master was walking through the forest when he came upon a student sitting in meditation..."

- Culturally appropriate

❌ **Avoid**:
- Stories without a clear purpose
- Overly long stories (500+ words)
- Cultural stereotypes or insensitive content
- Vague or unclear messages

---

### For Questions

✅ **Good Example**:
"What would you do differently if you knew you could not fail?"

- Open-ended (not yes/no)
- Thought-provoking
- Relevant to multiple contexts
- 10-25 words

❌ **Avoid**:
- Yes/no questions

### For Activities/Exercises

✅ **Include**:
- Clear step-by-step instructions
- Time needed (realistic estimate)

❌ **Avoid**:

---

### For Training Programs

## Multilingual Content

### Why 5 Languages?

- 🇩🇪 German (de)
- 🇮🇱 Hebrew (he) - *Note: Right-to-left language*

### If You Can Translate

**Awesome!** Provide translations in any languages you're fluent in.

**Important**:
- Only translate if you're fluent/native
- Keep the same meaning and tone
- Note any cultural adaptations needed
- Mention if some words don't translate directly

### If You Can't Translate

**No problem!** We'll arrange professional translation.

Just make sure to:
- Note any cultural context
- Mention words/concepts that might be hard to translate
- Flag any culture-specific metaphors or idioms

---

## Cultural Sensitivity

### Why It Matters

Content that works in one culture may not resonate (or could offend) in another.

### What to Consider

**Stories**:
- Is this story culture-specific?
- Would it make sense in other cultures?
- Are there cultural references that need explanation?

**Questions**:
- Could this question be uncomfortable in some cultures?
- Are there cultural assumptions embedded?
- Would this be asked differently in other contexts?

**Words**:
- Does this word have different meanings in different cultures?
- Are there cultural connotations (positive/negative)?
- Is this word even translatable?

**Activities**:
- Would this exercise work in all cultures?
- Are there cultural norms that might conflict?
- Do any props or materials have cultural significance?

### When in Doubt

**Add a note** in the "Cultural Considerations" section:
- "This story comes from Japanese culture and may need context"
- "This question assumes individualistic culture; might need adaptation"
- "This word has no direct translation in some languages"
- "This activity involves physical touch - check cultural norms"

Yes! All content includes creator attribution. You'll be credited on the platform.

### "Can I submit content in just one language?"

Yes, but content in all 5 languages is prioritized. We can arrange translation, but it takes longer.

We'll email you with specific feedback. Make the changes and resubmit. Most content is approved after one round of revisions.
