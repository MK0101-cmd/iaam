# Points of You AI Studio (for pros)

Owner: Miron Krokhmal

A web app (and Zoom/Teams add-in) that augments any session—coaching, HR workshops, therapy groups, classrooms.

**Core value**

- **Design**: drag-and-drop agendas using official decks (Coaching Game, Punctum, Faces, Flow, Speak Up).
- **Facilitate**: an **AI copilot** adapts prompts in real time (based on sentiment, participation, time left), runs breakouts, and tracks “airtime” to ensure every voice is heard.
- **Capture**: auto-transcribe (with consent), tag “insights”, and summarize outcomes/action items.
- **Report**: session analytics (engagement, themes, emotions), pre/post mini-surveys, export to PDF/LMS/HRIS.
- **Integrate**: works inside **Zoom/Teams**, embeds in **Miro/Mural**, exports to **Notion/Slack**.

**Signature features**

- **Digital Decks**: licensed, interactive card decks with shuffles, spreads, and AR **card scanner** (scan physical card → auto-load prompts & activities).
- **Protocol Marketplace**: curated playbooks by master trainers (conflict, leadership, feedback, SEL, trauma-safe circles).
- **Outcomes Library**: evidence-backed exercises with expected outcomes (empathy↑, psychological safety↑).
- **Privacy first**: consent flows, de-identification, local/enterprise storage option.
