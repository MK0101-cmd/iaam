# POY API/SDK

Owner: Miron Krokhmal

## Let partner LMSes, EAP platforms, and digital clinics embed **card-based reflective flows**.

- Read/Write: agendas, prompts, anonymized “insight tags,” outcomes.
- Compliance modes (GDPR/FERPA; optional HIPAA BAA for EAP/behavioral health use).

## 1) B2B API Services for Education, Learning & HR Platforms

## 1.1 Product surface

- **Core REST/GraphQL APIs**
    - **Protocols:** list/use POI legacy & goal-oriented protocols (`GET /protocols`, `POST /runs` to instantiate a protocol).
    - **Sessions:** create/attach Zoom/Meet, manage breakouts, consent, artifacts (`POST /sessions`, `/sessions/{id}/breakouts`, `/sessions/{id}/consent`).
    - **Signals:** realtime metrics (open-Q %, talk-time equity, affect drift) via **WS/SSE**; historical via REST (`GET /sessions/{id}/signals`).
    - **Nudges:** fetch/accept/dismiss AI suggestions (`POST /sessions/{id}/nudges:accept`).
    - **Homework & Journal:** CRUD + visibility controls (`/participants/{id}/homework`, `/journal`).
    - **Reports:** cohort, session, and participant rollups (`/reports/session/{id}`, `/reports/participant/{id}`, `/reports/cohort/{id}`).
- **Embeddable UI (white-label widgets)**
    - `<PoiJournalingWidget/>`, `<PoiHomeworkPanel/>`, `<PoiSignalsMini/>`, `<PoiNudgeTray/>`, `<PoiProtocolRunner/>` — drop-in React/Web Components with theme tokens.
- **Webhooks & Events**
    - `asr.segment.created`, `signal.snapshot.ready`, `nudge.created`, `homework.updated`, `journal.created`, `recording.imported`, `consent.updated`.
    - Retries + signed payloads (HMAC) with idempotency keys.
- **SDKs**
    - Server: Node/TS, Python.
    - Client: JS/TS; mobile helpers for iOS/Android (KMP or native modules) to embed journaling & homework.

## 1.2 LMS/LXP/EdTech specifics

- **LTI 1.3 (Advantage) launch** for single-click deep-links from LMS into a protocol run (grade passback optional).
- **xAPI (Tin Can)** emit statements for activities: `experienced`, `answered`, `completed`, with POI verb extensions for open-question use, reflection density, etc.
- **SCORM (read-only mapper)** to ingest historical completion data for baselining (optional).

## 1.3 HR/People systems specifics

- **SSO/SCIM** for provisioning groups/cohorts and de-provisioning leavers.
- **Goal-oriented protocols** for 1:1s, performance conversations, onboarding check-ins, conflict mediation; export summaries with evidence snippets to HRIS or ticketing tools.
- **Privacy modes:** personal journals default private; only shared entries flow to HR reports when explicit.

## 1.4 Security, tenancy, and compliance

- **Multi-tenant isolation** (OrgID in every row + row-level policies); **BYOK** (per-tenant KMS keys).
- **OAuth2/JWT** with fine-grained scopes (e.g., `sessions:write`, `signals:read`, `journal:self`).
- **Consent gates** enforced server-side before ASR/signals/nudges run.
- **Data residency** (EU/US regions), **audit logs**, retention policies.
- **On-prem / VPC** option: containerized services + pluggable LLM/ASR backends (see prior on-prem plan).
