## Multilingual Support Framework

### Overview

All content types in this dictionary support **5 languages**: English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), German (de), and Hebrew (he). This section defines the standardized approach to multilingual support across all content types.

### Supported Languages

| Language | Code | Native Name | RTL | Status |
|----------|------|-------------|-----|--------|
| English | en | English | No | Default/Source |
| Spanish | es | Español | No | Full Support |
| French | fr | Français | No | Full Support |
| German | de | Deutsch | No | Full Support |
| Hebrew | he | עברית | **Yes** | Full Support + RTL |

### Standard Multilingual Support Interface

Every content type includes this standardized multilingual support specification:

```typescript
interface MultilingualSupport {
  // Translation Requirements
  requires_translation: boolean;
  translation_priority: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  translatable_fields: string[];
  non_translatable_fields: string[];
  
  // RTL Support (for Hebrew)
  rtl_affected: boolean;
  rtl_layout_adjustments: string[];
  
  // Cultural Adaptation
  cultural_adaptation_level: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' | 'none';
  cultural_considerations: string[];
  
  // Implementation
  implementation_status: 'implemented' | 'in_progress' | 'planned' | 'not_started';
  i18n_namespace: string;
  translation_notes: string[];
  
  // Quality Assurance
  requires_professional_translation: boolean;
  requires_cultural_consultant: boolean;
  estimated_word_count: number;
}
```

### Translation Priority Levels

#### CRITICAL
- User-facing content essential for platform operation
- UI elements, navigation, core features
- Error messages, validation text
- **Must be translated before launch**

#### HIGH
- Training content, educational materials
- Official templates, building blocks
- Certification materials
- **Required for full feature functionality**

#### MEDIUM
- Advanced features, optional content
- Marketing materials, help documentation
- Extended content libraries
- **Enhances user experience**

#### LOW
- Administrative content, internal tools
- Debug messages, system logs
- Optional enhancements
- **Nice to have**

### Cultural Adaptation Levels

#### HIGH
- Content with significant cultural context
- Communication styles, social norms
- Values, principles, examples
- **Requires cultural consultant review**

#### MEDIUM
- Content with some cultural variation
- Training techniques, facilitation approaches
- Team dynamics, role descriptions
- **Benefits from cultural review**

#### LOW
- Mostly universal content
- Technical instructions, processes
- Visual layouts, navigation
- **Standard translation sufficient**

#### NONE
- Purely technical content
- Code, identifiers, metrics
- Universal symbols, numbers
- **No cultural adaptation needed**

### RTL (Right-to-Left) Support

For Hebrew language support, content types must specify:

1. **Text Direction**: Automatic reversal of text flow
2. **Layout Mirroring**: UI elements mirror horizontally
3. **Icon Placement**: Directional icons flip
4. **Navigation Flow**: Menu and navigation reverse
5. **Form Layouts**: Input fields align right
6. **Visual Hierarchies**: Reading order reverses

### i18n Namespace Structure

All content types use hierarchical i18n namespaces:

```
common.*                    - Shared UI elements
cards.thematic.*           - Thematic cards
cards.question.*           - Question cards
cards.word.*               - Word cards
journey.phases.*           - Journey phases
journey.elements.*         - Journey elements
canvas.*                   - Canvas UI and features
canvas.templates.*         - Canvas templates
training.templates.*       - Training templates
training.blocks.*          - Building blocks
trainer.roles.*            - Trainer development
trainer.qualities.*        - Trainer qualities
trainer.energy.*           - Energy modes
certification.*            - Certification system
tools.facilitation.*       - Facilitation tools
tools.communication.*      - Communication tools
values.*                   - Core values
principles.*               - Ground principles
session.*                  - Session management
analytics.*                - Analytics labels
```

### Translation Workflow

1. **Source Content Creation**: Create in English (source language)
2. **Translation Key Assignment**: Assign hierarchical i18n keys
3. **Professional Translation**: Engage qualified translators
4. **Cultural Review**: Cultural consultant reviews adaptations
5. **QA Testing**: Native speaker testing per language
6. **Implementation**: Deploy translated content
7. **Continuous Updates**: Maintain translations as content evolves

### Quality Standards

#### Translation Quality
- **Native speaker fluency** required
- **Professional translator** credentials
- **Subject matter expertise** for technical content
- **Consistency** with existing translations
- **Terminology management** across all content

#### Cultural Quality
- **Cultural appropriateness** validated
- **Local examples** and metaphors used where applicable
- **Cultural consultant** approval for high-adaptation content
- **Regional variations** documented
- **Sensitivity** to cultural differences

### Implementation Status Definitions

- **implemented**: Fully translated, tested, and deployed in all 5 languages
- **in_progress**: Translation underway, partial language coverage
- **planned**: Translation scheduled, resources allocated
- **not_started**: No translation work begun, requires prioritization

## Methodology Framework

### 19. Facilitation vs Training
**Type**: `methodology_type`  
**Purpose**: Clear distinction between two complementary approaches in Points of You practice.

#### Facilitation

**What It Is**:
Creating immersive experiences that evoke emotional responses rather than transferring knowledge.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Focus**: Making participants feel something through curated interactions
- **Tools**: Wide variety - verbal prompts, visual tools, vision boards, photographs, body work, eco-therapy, group healing
- **Approach**: Holding space for reflection and growth, respecting personal journeys
- **Position**: Facilitator never part of the group, remains impartial guide
- **Outcome**: Creating conditions for further personal growth

**Power Source**:
Emotional connection and shared humanity experience, emphasizing diversity and inclusiveness, bridging cultural differences.

#### Training

**What It Is**:
Equipping individuals with skills and tools to apply Points of You methodology effectively in professional and personal contexts.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Focus**: Teaching the "why" behind processes and how to apply them
- **Approach**: Structured approach combining theory with practical application
- **Outcome**: Confidence and competence to use tools independently
- **Method**: Clear framework for tools, focusing on communication and coaching methods

**Key Difference**:
Unlike facilitation (fluid and responsive to emotions), training imparts specific knowledge and skills with clear framework for replication.

#### When to Use Each

**Use Facilitation When**:
- Creating emotional breakthroughs
- Participants need space for self-discovery
- Goal is personal growth and reflection
- Working with sensitive or vulnerable groups
- Focus is on healing or transformation

**Use Training When**:
- Teaching specific skills
- Participants must learn to apply tools independently
- Goal is knowledge transfer and skill development
- Preparing people to become facilitators
- Focus is on practical application
