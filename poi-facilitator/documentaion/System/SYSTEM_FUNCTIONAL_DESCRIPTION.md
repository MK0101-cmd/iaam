# Points of You AI Studio - System Functional Description

## Executive Summary

Points of You AI Studio is a comprehensive web-based platform that digitizes and enhances the Points of You methodology for professional facilitators, coaches, and educators. The current implementation is a sophisticated frontend prototype that demonstrates the complete user experience across all user types, featuring interactive card-based facilitation, AI coach interfaces, comprehensive session management mockups, and a **priority Visual Canvas/Whiteboard feature** for collaborative visual exercises.

**Current Status**: Frontend prototype with complete UI/UX implementation. Backend services, real AI integration, video conferencing, and the Visual Canvas/Whiteboard system are planned for future development phases.

### Key Architectural Decisions (Phase 1)

1. **Dual-Mode Journal Architecture**: The journal functions as both a standalone web application and an integrated in-session component, using unified authentication to provide seamless access across contexts.

2. **Hybrid Video Strategy**: Phase 1 runs alongside Zoom conferencing rather than integrating native video, with facilitators sharing canvas screens through Zoom's screen sharing feature. This reduces development complexity while maintaining full collaborative functionality.

3. **Privacy-First Canvas Design**: Canvas implements private and shared modes, where owners can selectively share canvases with specific participants through the participant web interface.

4. **AI-Driven Facilitator Insights**: The system collects and analyzes participant canvas operations (card placement, drawing behavior, collaboration patterns) to provide facilitators with real-time AI-generated insights and recommendations.
