## Part 2: 4-Phase Process Design

### 2.1 Phase 1: PAUSE (Opening) *REQUIRED*

**Duration**: 10 minutes

**Purpose**:
```
To center participants, create safety, and orient them to values exploration as a personal journey without judgment.
```

**Facilitator Script**:
```
"Welcome. Today we're going to explore something deeply personal - the values that guide you, even when you're not aware of them. There are no right or wrong values, no 'should be's. This is about discovering what's true for you. Let's begin by taking a moment to arrive fully. [Pause for 3 breaths together] Notice what brought you here today. What in you is curious about your inner compass?"
```
[Annotation: Warm, inviting, sets tone of non-judgment, uses activity metaphor]

**Participant Actions**:
```
- [ ] Arrive and settle into space
- [ ] Participate in brief centering practice
- [ ] Notice their own curiosity or resistance
```

**Grounding Technique**:
```
Three-breath arrival: Invite participants to place hand on heart, take three slow breaths, and with each exhale, let go of what they were doing before arriving. "Breathe in arrival. Breathe out everything else."
```

---

### 2.2 Phase 2: CARDS (Exploration) *REQUIRED*

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Card Introduction**:
```
"In a moment, you'll look through the deck and choose 5 cards that somehow speak to you about values - maybe they show something you cherish, or something you aspire to, or even something you've lost touch with. Don't overthink it. Let your inner compass guide your hand."
```

**Card Selection Process**:
```
1. Spread cards face-up where all can be seen
2. Invite participants to browse slowly, noticing which images draw their attention
3. Select 5 cards intuitively - first responses, not analyzed choices  
4. Once selected, bring cards to canvas workspace
5. Place cards on canvas in any arrangement that feels right
```
[Annotation: Clear step-by-step, honors intuition, allows personal arrangement]

**Initial Reflection Prompts**:
```
1. As you look at your first card, what value or quality does it represent for you? Name it.
2. Your second card - what does this one speak to in you? What does it represent?
3. Third card - notice how this one is similar to or different from the others.
4. Fourth card - what value is emerging here?
5. Fifth card - what completes your set? What value does this represent?
```

**Canvas Placement Guidance**:
```
"Arrange your 5 cards on your canvas in a way that feels right. They might form a circle, a path, a constellation. Some might be close together, others further apart. The arrangement itself might tell you something about how these values relate."
```

---

### 2.3 Phase 3: EXPANDING (Deepening) *REQUIRED*

**Duration**: 35 minutes

**Expansion Techniques** (checked all used):
- [x] Drawing connections between cards
- [x] Adding words/phrases
- [x] Creating visual metaphors
- [x] Mapping relationships

**Deepening Questions**:
```
1. Look at your 5 values cards. If this is your inner compass, what direction is it pointing you?

2. Which value feels most alive in your life right now? Which one is calling for more attention?

3. Draw or write about how these values connect. Are some foundational? Are some in tension with each other?

4. If you had to give up one of these values, which would be hardest to lose? What does that tell you?

5. Add words, images, or colors that deepen each value. What makes "courage" uniquely yours? What flavor of "love" is this?

6. Is there a value missing from your compass? Something you know belongs but didn't choose? Why not?

7. Looking at your compass as a whole, what story does it tell about who you are and what matters to you?
```
[Annotation: Questions progress from description to meaning to integration, last question synthesizes]

**Canvas Development**:
```
Participants enhance their canvases by:
- Drawing connecting lines (solid/dotted/arrows) showing relationships
- Adding personal words defining what each value means to them
- Using colors to show energy/vitality of each value
- Creating symbols or metaphors that personalize each value
- Noting where values support or tension each other
```

**Facilitator Observations**:
```
Watch for: Participants who struggle to name values (offer value words list), participants who rush vs. those who linger, emotional responses to certain values, "should" language appearing, values in conflict emerging.
```

---

### 2.4 Phase 4: FOCUS (Integration) *REQUIRED*

**Duration**: 20 minutes

**Integration Approach**:
```
Guide participants to move from exploration to commitment. "Your inner compass is now visible. The question becomes: How will you use it? What decisions are waiting for this clarity? What becomes possible when you know what truly guides you?"
```

**Closing Questions**:
```
1. Looking at your inner compass, what one insight surprises you or feels particularly important?

2. Is there a decision you're facing where this compass could guide you? What does your compass say?

3. Which value most wants your attention in the coming week? How will you honor it?

4. If you were to share your inner compass with someone close to you, what would you want them to understand?

5. What would living more aligned with these values look like in your daily life?
```

**Action Planning**:
```
"Choose one value from your compass. In the next week, commit to one small action that honors that value. Write it down. Make it specific. This is how your inner compass guides your steps."
```

**Closing Ritual**:
```
Invite participants to place hand on their canvas and silently acknowledge their inner compass. Then share one word that captures how they're feeling now. Go around circle, each person offering their word. Close with: "Your inner compass is yours. May it guide you true."
```

## Part 3: Facilitator Guide

### 3.1 Preparation Checklist *REQUIRED*

**Materials Needed**:
```
- [ ] Canvas platform access for all participants (digital or physical)
- [ ] The Coaching Game deck (full set, 65 cards minimum)
- [ ] List of value words (for participants who need support)
- [ ] Drawing tools (if physical canvas) or digital drawing capability
- [ ] Participant workbook pages
- [ ] Timer
```

**Space Setup**:
```
Quiet space with minimal distractions. If in-person: circle or U-shape seating with large tables/floor space for canvas work. Cards spread where all can browse. Ensure privacy if sharing personal values. If virtual: test canvas platform, ensure participants can see card images clearly, have breakout room capability for pairs.
```

**Pre-Session Preparation**:
```
1. Test all technology (canvas platform, card image access)
2. Review PERMA model and values theory
3. Prepare personal example of your own inner compass (for modeling)
4. Set intention for holding safe, non-judgmental space
5. Have crisis resources ready (if therapeutic context)
```

### 3.2 Facilitator Mindset & Approach *REQUIRED*
```
Approach as witness, not expert. Your role is to hold space for discovery, not to interpret their values or suggest what "should" matter. Model curiosity without judgment. Honor silence and processing time. Trust participants' inner knowing. Stay grounded and present - your calm enables their depth.
```

### 3.3 Timing Breakdown *REQUIRED*

**Total Duration**: 90 minutes

**Phase Distribution**:
```
- Pause: 10 min
- Cards: 25 min
- Expanding: 35 min
- Focus: 20 min
- Buffer: flexible pacing within phases
```

**Pacing Notes**:
```
Expanding phase needs most time - don't rush. If running long, shorten Focus to 15 min. Never cut Pause short - grounding is essential.
```

### 3.4 Common Challenges & Solutions *REQUIRED*

**Challenge 1**:
```
**Situation**: Participant struggles to name values from cards
**Solution**: Offer values word list ("Does 'courage' fit? Creativity? Connection?"). Normalize that we don't always have words for what matters. Invite them to describe what they see and help name it together.
```

**Challenge 2**:
```
**Situation**: Participant realizes they're living out of alignment with their values - becomes distressed
**Solution**: Validate that awareness is the first step. Reframe as gift of clarity. Ask: "What's one small way you could honor this value this week?" Focus on possibility, not shame.
```

**Challenge 3**:
```
**Situation**: Participant selects "should" values (what they think they should value vs. what they do)
**Solution**: Gently invite inquiry: "Is this a value you're living, or one you think you should have?" Create permission to be honest. "Your true compass serves you better than an ideal one."
```

**Challenge 4**:
```
**Situation**: Values are in obvious conflict (career success vs. family time)
**Solution**: Name it: "I notice these two values might pull in different directions sometimes." Explore: "What's the wisdom in holding both? How do you navigate that tension?" Conflict between values is normal and human.
```

**Challenge 5**:
```
**Situation**: Participant becomes emotional when touching a value they've lost or ignored
**Solution**: Slow down. Create space. "It sounds like this value is tender for you." Offer tissue, silence, validation. Don't rush past emotion - it's information. Ask: "What does this feeling tell you about what matters?"
```

### 3.5 Variations & Adaptations *REQUIRED*
```
**For teams**: Each person creates compass, then team creates collective compass - "What values do we share? Where are we different? How do our compasses create our team culture?"

**For couples**: Create individual compasses, then dialogue about alignment and difference. "Where do our compasses point the same way? Where different? How do we honor both?"

**60-min version**: 3 cards instead of 5, shorten Expanding to 20 min.
```

### 3.6 Safety & Ethics *REQUIRED*
```
**Emotional Safety**: This activity can surface grief about unlived values, shame about misalignment, or painful value conflicts. Create explicit permission for emotions. Have resources for follow-up support.

**Confidentiality**: Remind participants that values shared are personal. Set group agreement about confidentiality.

**Scope of Practice**: If participant discloses trauma or mental health concerns, acknowledge, validate, don't try to resolve. Offer appropriate referrals.

**Value Neutrality**: Facilitator must not impose their values or judge participants' values. ALL values are welcome for exploration.
```
