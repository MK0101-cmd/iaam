## Part 1: Theory Foundation

### 1.1 Phototherapy Background *REQUIRED* | Max 1000 characters

**What this is**: Brief overview of the phototherapy approach you're integrating, including its theoretical foundations and core principles.

**Guidelines**:
- Explain phototherapy in 2-3 paragraphs
- Reference Judy Weiser's work appropriately
- Identify 5 core phototherapy techniques
- Explain multiperspectivity principle
- Connect to therapeutic value
- Character limit: 0/1000

**Best Practices**:
✅ DO: "Phototherapy, as developed by Judy Weiser, is a therapeutic approach using photographs as tools for exploring memory, identity, emotion, and relationships. Weiser identified five core techniques..."

❌ DON'T: "Phototherapy is using photos. Judy Weiser invented it. It's good for therapy."

**Example**:
```
Phototherapy, as developed by Judy Weiser, Ph.D., is a therapeutic approach that uses photographs as catalysts for exploring memory, identity, emotion, relationships, and unconscious material. Weiser identified five core techniques: (1) photos taken by the client, (2) photos of the client, (3) family albums, (4) photos collected by others, and (5) photo-projectives (symbolic images).

At the core of phototherapy is the principle of multiperspectivity - the recognition that there is no single truth, only multiple points of view waiting to be seen. Images serve as mirrors for internal states, with meaning emerging not from the image itself but from how the viewer relates to it. This projective nature, combined with respectful curiosity and co-created meaning, makes phototherapy a powerful tool for deep psychological exploration and healing.
```

**Your Input**:
```




[Continue here...]





```

---

### 1.2 POY Methodology Connection *REQUIRED* | Max 800 characters

**What this is**: Explicit connection between phototherapy principles and Points of You methodology.

**Guidelines**:
- Explain how POY embodies phototherapy principles
- Identify shared values (multiperspectivity, projection, co-creation)
- Explain why POY cards are effective phototherapy tools
- Connect to POY core values
- Character limit: 0/800

**Best Practices**:
✅ DO: "Points of You methodology deeply aligns with phototherapy principles. Both approaches honor multiperspectivity, use visual stimuli as projective tools, and emphasize co-created meaning..."

❌ DON'T: "POY is like phototherapy. They both use pictures."

**Your Input**:
```






```

---

### 1.3 Key Theoretical Principles (List 5-7 principles) *REQUIRED*

**What this is**: Core theoretical principles guiding phototherapy-POY integration for AI implementation.

**Guidelines**:
- Minimum 5, maximum 7 principles
- Each principle should be actionable for AI implementation
- Include brief explanation (1-2 sentences each)
- Prioritize safety, ethics, and therapeutic value
- Connect to both phototherapy and POY methodology

**Example Principles**:
1. **Projective Nature**: Images serve as mirrors for internal states; meaning emerges from viewer's relationship to image, not from image itself
2. **Co-created Meaning**: Understanding develops through collaborative dialogue; AI facilitates rather than interprets
3. **Respectful Curiosity**: Questions open possibilities rather than close them; AI maintains non-judgmental stance
4. **Multiperspectivity**: Multiple valid viewpoints exist; AI acknowledges and explores diverse perspectives
5. **Safety First**: Emotional safety is paramount; AI monitors for distress and provides resources

**Your Input**:
```
1. **[Principle Name]**: [1-2 sentence explanation]

2. **[Principle Name]**: [1-2 sentence explanation]

3. **[Principle Name]**: [1-2 sentence explanation]
