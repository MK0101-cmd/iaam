## Part 5: Translation Readiness

### 5.1 Translatable Content

**List all content requiring translation** (check all that apply):

- [x] Visual description
- [x] Visual elements list (5 items)
- [x] Symbolic meanings (5 sets)
- [x] Reflection Theme #1 (complete text)
- [x] Reflection Theme #2 (complete text)
- [x] Reflection Theme #3 (complete text)
- [x] Reflection Theme #4 (complete text)
- [x] Reflection Theme #5 (complete text)

- [x] Management/team adaptations (if completed)

**Non-Translatable Content**:
- Template version number
- Character limits
- Field names ("Reflection Theme #1", etc.)

---

### 5.2 Cultural Adaptation Notes

**Cultural Considerations**:
```
1. The concept of "work-life balance" (implicit in Theme #1) varies significantly across cultures. In collectivist cultures, may need reframing to emphasize family/community harmony rather than individual balance.

2. The bicycle as a symbol of personal journey and independence may resonate differently in cultures where communal or family-based decision-making is primary. May need adaptation to acknowledge collective journeys.

3. "Nature connection" (Theme #5) assumes access to natural environments. In urban or resource-constrained contexts, may need broadening to include any connection to natural elements (plants, sky, seasons).
```

**Suggested Adaptations**:
```
For collectivist cultures:
- Theme #1: Reframe "support systems" to emphasize family and community networks explicitly
- Theme #4: Adapt "personal path" to acknowledge family/community goals and collective journeys

For cultures with limited nature access:
- Theme #5: Broaden to include connection to any natural elements - houseplants, seasonal changes visible from windows, sky, weather patterns

For cultures with different seasonal cycles:
- Theme #3: Adapt "autumn leaves" reference to "seasonal transition" more generally to work across hemispheres and climates
```

### 7.2 Submission Notes

**Any questions or concerns for reviewer**:
```
This is my first reflection prompt for a thematic card. I've ensured all themes use open-ended questions and non-judgmental language. I'm particularly interested in feedback on whether the progressive depth across the 5 themes feels natural and whether the cultural adaptation notes are sufficient.

I've provided both therapy and professional context adaptations for 2 themes each, focusing on the ones that benefit most from specific framing.
```

---

## Why This Example Works

### Strengths of This Reflection Set:

1. **Clear Visual Analysis**: The visual description is specific and objective, providing a foundation for symbolic interpretation.

2. **Rich Symbolic Meanings**: Each visual element has multiple symbolic dimensions, allowing for diverse theme development.

3. **Progressive Depth**: The 5 themes create a natural journey:
   - Theme #1: Accessible entry (support systems)
   - Theme #2: Internal exploration (hidden potential)
   - Theme #3: Emotional dimension (change and transition)
   - Theme #4: Action orientation (movement and direction)
   - Theme #5: Integration (connection to larger context)

4. **Open-Ended Questions**: Every question invites exploration rather than yes/no answers:
   - "Who or what do you lean on?"
   - "What potential is waiting to be uncovered?"
   - "How do you feel about the current phase?"
   - "Where are you headed?"
   - "How might deepening this connection support you?"

5. **Universal Themes**: All themes are relatable across cultures, ages, and contexts:
   - Support and stability (universal human need)
   - Hidden potential (applies to all people)
   - Seasons of change (natural life cycles)
   - Personal journey (metaphor works globally)
   - Nature connection (basic human relationship)

6. **Non-Judgmental Language**: No prescriptive or judgmental phrases:
   - Uses "might", "could", "invite" rather than "should", "must", "need to"
   - Acknowledges multiple possibilities
   - Respects user's autonomy and wisdom

7. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Proactive identification of adaptation needs:
   - Noted individualism assumptions
   - Suggested collectivist adaptations
   - Acknowledged different contexts for nature access
   - Considered seasonal variations across hemispheres

8. **Translation Ready**: Sufficient buffer for character expansion:
   - All themes under 360 characters (allows 30% expansion)
   - Clear translation notes provided
   - Cultural consultant flagged for high-adaptation elements

### Use This Example As Your Quality Benchmark

When creating your own reflection prompts, aim for this level of:
- **Depth**: Rich, multi-layered themes
- **Clarity**: Clear, specific language
- **Universality**: Globally relatable concepts
- **Openness**: Genuine invitation to explore
- **Progression**: Natural journey across themes
- **Sensitivity**: Cultural awareness and adaptation
