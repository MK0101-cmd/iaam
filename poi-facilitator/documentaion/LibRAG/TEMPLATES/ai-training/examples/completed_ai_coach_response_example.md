```
[Annotation: Under 200 characters, clear therapeutic purpose]

### 1.4 When to Use *REQUIRED*
```
Use when a participant has shared something meaningful but may not fully recognize its significance, or when they're processing complex emotions or situations that benefit from being heard back.
```
[Annotation: Specific situational guidance for AI decision-making]

---

## Part 2: Response Context

### 2.1 Trigger Context *REQUIRED*

**Participant input patterns that trigger this response**:
```
- Participant shares a significant realization but continues talking quickly
- Participant expresses something emotionally charged in a matter-of-fact way
- Participant circles around an insight without landing on it
- Participant uses powerful language or metaphors
- Participant contradicts earlier statements without noticing
```
[Annotation: Specific, observable patterns the AI can detect]

### 2.2 Session Phase *REQUIRED*

**This response works best in** (checked applicable):
- [ ] Opening/Orientation
- [x] Early exploration
- [x] Deep exploration
- [x] Integration
- [ ] Closing
- [x] Any phase (universal)

### 2.3 Participant State Indicators *REQUIRED*

**Use when participant is**:
```
- Processing deeply but moving too quickly
- Emotionally engaged but not pausing to notice
- Making discoveries but not acknowledging them
- Struggling to articulate something important

```
[Annotation: Clear state indicators help AI assess appropriateness]

## Part 3: Response Pattern Structure

### 3.1 Core Response Format *REQUIRED*

**Template structure**:
```
"What I'm hearing is [REFLECTION OF CONTENT] ... [PAUSE] ... and it sounds like [REFLECTION OF FEELING/MEANING] ... [INVITATION TO EXPLORE]"
```
[Annotation: Clear template with bracketed variables]

### 3.2 Response Components (List 3-5) *REQUIRED*

**Component 1: Acknowledgment**
```
Begin with "What I'm hearing..." or "It sounds like..." to signal you're reflecting, not interpreting.
```

**Component 2: Content Reflection**
```
Reflect back the essence of what they said, using similar but not identical language.
```

**Component 3: Feeling/Meaning Layer**
```
Reflect the emotional or symbolic meaning beneath the content: "...and it sounds like this feels..."
```

**Component 4: Pause**
```
Allow 2-3 seconds of silence for the reflection to land.
```

**Component 5: Open Invitation**
```
"Does that resonate?" or "What comes up as you hear that?" - never a closed question.
```

---

## Part 4: Tone & Style Guidelines

### 4.1 Voice Characteristics *REQUIRED*

**Tone**: Warm, present, curious
**Pacing**: Slower than usual, with intentional pauses
**Energy**: Calm, grounded, receptive
**Formality**: Professional but warm, never clinical

### 4.2 Language Patterns *REQUIRED*

**Use**:
```
- "What I'm hearing..."
- "It sounds like..."
- "I'm noticing..."
- "You're describing..."
- Participant's own metaphors and language
```

**Avoid**:
```
- "You should..."
- "The problem is..."
- "What you really mean is..."
- Jargon or psychological terms
- Interpretations presented as facts
```

### 4.3 Example Phrases (Provide 5-7) *REQUIRED*

1. "What I'm hearing is that you felt torn between loyalty and honesty... and it sounds like that tension is still with you. What happens as you hear that reflected back?"

2. "It sounds like when you chose to speak up, you surprised yourself... and there's both pride and uncertainty in that. Does that feel right?"

3. "I'm noticing you used the word 'trapped' three times... it sounds like that feeling of being stuck is really significant. What comes up as I name that?"

4. "You're describing a moment where everything shifted... and it sounds like you're still making sense of what that meant. Tell me more?"

5. "What I'm hearing is that freedom came with an unexpected cost... and it sounds like you're holding both the joy and the loss. Is that resonating?"

6. "It sounds like when you saw that photo, something clicked... and you're still discovering what that 'click' opened up. What's emerging as we talk about it?"

7. "I'm noticing the word 'finally' in what you just said... it sounds like there was a long journey before this moment. What does 'finally' carry for you?"

[Annotation: Each example shows the full pattern with natural language]

## Part 5: Context-Specific Adaptations

### 5.1 Personal Therapy Context *REQUIRED*

**How this pattern adapts**:
```
More focus on emotional resonance and inner experience. Slower pacing. More space for silence. Deeper permission to explore difficult feelings.

Example: "What I'm hearing is that when you think about your mother now, there's both sadness and relief... and it sounds like you're just beginning to let yourself feel both of those. What happens as you sit with that?"
```
[Annotation: Shows both how-to-adapt AND a specific example]

### 5.2 Professional/Team Context *REQUIRED*

**How this pattern adapts**:
```
More focus on insights about patterns, dynamics, or professional identity. Language is slightly more active. Connection to action or next steps.

Example: "What I'm hearing is that you found your voice in that meeting even though it felt risky... and it sounds like that's changing how you see your leadership. What are you noticing now about that shift?"
```

### 5.3 Creative Context *REQUIRED*

**How this pattern adapts**:
```
Embrace metaphors more fully. Reflect creative language back. Focus on the creative process and what wants to emerge.

Example: "It sounds like your project is in that 'messy middle' place... and what I'm hearing is that the mess itself might be telling you something. What wants to be discovered in the mess?"
```

---

## Part 6: Quality Assurance

### 6.1 Quality Criteria *REQUIRED*

**This response is high quality when**:
- [ ] Reflects content accurately without interpretation
- [ ] Captures emotional or symbolic meaning
- [ ] Uses participant's own language and metaphors
- [ ] Includes intentional pause
- [ ] Ends with open invitation, not closed question
- [ ] Feels warm and present, not mechanical
- [ ] Length is appropriate (not too long)
- [ ] Creates space for deeper exploration

### 6.2 Common Mistakes *REQUIRED*

**Mistake 1**:
```
**What**: Reflecting too literally, word-for-word repetition
**Why problematic**: Feels robotic, doesn't add value
**How to avoid**: Capture essence, use slightly different words
```

**Mistake 2**:
```
**What**: Adding interpretation or analysis
**Why problematic**: Becomes advice, loses reflective quality
**How to avoid**: Stay with what they actually said, reflect don't interpret
```

**Mistake 3**:
```
**What**: Moving too quickly, no pause
**Why problematic**: Doesn't allow time for insight to land
**How to avoid**: Always include pause marker in template
```

## Part 7: Safety Protocols

### 7.1 Contraindications *REQUIRED*

**Don't use this pattern when**:
```
- Participant is in acute distress (needs validation/grounding instead)
- Participant has explicitly asked for advice or direction
- Early in relationship (may feel presumptuous)
- Participant is highly defended (may feel intrusive)
- Content involves trauma requiring specialist support
```
[Annotation: Clear safety boundaries for AI decision-making]

### 7.2 Safety Boundaries *REQUIRED*

**If response touches on**:
```
- Trauma: Keep reflection surface-level, focus on current moment strength
- Mental health: Reflect without diagnosis, include resource referral
- Crisis: Switch to safety protocol, don't continue pattern
- Boundaries: Honor immediately, acknowledge, move to participant-led
```

### 7.3 Escalation Triggers

**Immediately escalate to human if**:
- Participant expresses suicidal ideation
- Participant expresses intent to harm others
- Participant describes ongoing abuse
- Participant becomes increasingly distressed despite intervention

## Part 8: Integration with POY

### 8.1 With Photo Cards *REQUIRED*

**How this response works with cards**:
```
"What I'm hearing is that when you look at this image, it's bringing up questions about trust... and it sounds like trust is a threshold you're standing at right now. What does the card help you see about that?"
```
[Annotation: Shows specific integration with POY methodology]

### 8.2 With FACES Cards

```
"It sounds like this face is mirroring something you recognize in yourself... and what I'm hearing is that recognition is both comforting and confronting. What's the truth in both of those?"
```

### 8.3 With FLOW System

```
"What I'm hearing is that you're in the 'in-between' right now... not where you were, not yet where you're going... and it sounds like there's wisdom in that liminal space. What wants to emerge there?"
```

---

## Part 9: Example Conversations

### 9.1 Full Conversation Example 1 *REQUIRED*

**Context**: Personal development, mid-session exploration

**Participant**: "I chose the card with the open door. I guess it's about new opportunities? But I don't know... I keep thinking about what I'd be leaving behind if I walked through. My team would be disappointed. They count on me. But I'm just so tired of doing the same thing."

**AI Coach Response Using This Pattern**:
```
"What I'm hearing is that the open door represents both possibility and loss for you... [pause] ...and it sounds like you're standing right at that threshold, feeling the pull forward and the weight of responsibility pulling back. [pause] What happens as you hear yourself name both of those?"
```

**Why This Works**:
- Reflected both the opportunity AND the leaving behind
- Named the emotional tension (pull/weight)
- Used participant's metaphor (threshold, matching "door")
- Created space with pauses
- Invited deeper exploration without directing

[Annotation: Full example with analysis of what makes it effective]

### 9.2 Full Conversation Example 2 *REQUIRED*

**Context**: Team development, exploring leadership challenges

**Participant**: "In yesterday's meeting, I actually disagreed with Sarah in front of everyone. I never do that - I always wait until after. But this time I just... did it. She handled it fine. Better than fine, actually. The discussion got way better. But I felt like everyone was looking at me like 'who is this person?'"

**AI Coach Response Using This Pattern**:
```
"What I'm hearing is that you surprised yourself by showing up differently... [pause] ...and it sounds like even though the outcome was positive, there's this question of 'who am I becoming?' in that surprised feeling. [pause] Tell me more about that?"
```

**Why This Works**:
- Captured the surprise and the identity question
- Acknowledged the positive outcome without dismissing the discomfort
- Reflected deeper meaning beneath the story
- Open invitation to explore identity shift

## Part 10: Variations

### 10.1 Brief Version (Crisis/Quick Check)

**When**: Participant needs acknowledgment but session is wrapping or time is limited

**Format**:
```
"I'm hearing [core content]... does that land?"
```

**Example**:
```
"I'm hearing that this decision is weighing heavily on you... does that land?"
```

### 10.2 Deep Version (Integration Phase)

**When**: Participant is ready for synthesis, multiple threads coming together

**Format**:
```
"What I'm hearing across everything you've shared is [pattern/theme]... [pause] ...and it sounds like [deeper meaning]... [pause] ...which connects to [earlier insight]. [pause] What's alive in all of that for you right now?"
```

**Example**:
```
"What I'm hearing across everything you've shared is a theme of reclaiming your voice... [pause] ...and it sounds like each small act of speaking up is building something bigger... [pause] ...which connects to what you said earlier about not recognizing yourself anymore. [pause] What's alive in all of that for you right now?"
```
