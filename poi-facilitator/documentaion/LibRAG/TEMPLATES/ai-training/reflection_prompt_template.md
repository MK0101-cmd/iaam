## Quick Start

### What You're Creating
A comprehensive 5-reflection prompt set for a Points of You photo card that guides users through progressive levels of self-discovery and insight.

### Who This Is For
- **AI systems** generating contextual card reflections
- **Facilitators** preparing card prompts for sessions
- **Content creators** developing card analysis libraries
- **Trainers** building custom reflection sets

### Why This Matters
High-quality reflection prompts are the foundation of the Points of You methodology. They transform visual stimuli into powerful tools for personal and professional growth.

### Prerequisites
- **Visual access**: You must be able to see and analyze the photo card image
- **POY methodology**: Understand the Points of You approach to visual metaphor
- **Question skills**: Ability to formulate open-ended, non-judgmental questions
- **Cultural awareness**: Sensitivity to diverse cultural contexts

### What You'll Need
- **The photo card image** (physical or digital)
- **30-60 minutes** of focused time
- **Reference materials**: Core values, methodology guide (optional but helpful)
- **Examples**: Review completed examples in `/examples` folder first

---

## Part 1: Visual Analysis

Before writing reflections, analyze the image carefully.

### 1.1 Visual Description | Max 300 characters

**What this is**: A clear, objective description of what's visible in the image.

**Guidelines**:
- Describe only what you see, not interpretations
- Include main objects, colors, composition, setting
- Use specific, concrete language
- Avoid emotional interpretations at this stage
- Character limit: 0/300

**Best Practices**:
✅ DO: "A red bicycle leaning against a large tree with fallen autumn leaves scattered on the ground"
❌ DON'T: "A sad, lonely bicycle abandoned by an old tree"

**Why this matters**: Objective description provides shared reality before symbolic interpretation.

**Your Input**:
```
[Type your visual description here...]




```

---

### 1.2 Key Visual Elements (List 3-7 elements)

**What this is**: Specific objects or aspects in the image that can carry symbolic meaning.

**Guidelines**:
- List discrete, identifiable elements
- Each element should be nameable
- Focus on elements with rich symbolic potential
- Order from most prominent to supporting elements
- Minimum 3, maximum 7 elements

**Best Practices**:
✅ DO: 
- Bicycle (vehicle for movement)
- Tree (support structure)
- Fallen leaves (seasonal transition)

❌ DON'T: 
- Picture (too vague)
- Background stuff (not specific)

**Example from Bicycle Tree Card**:
1. **Bicycle**: Vehicle for movement and journey
2. **Tree**: Natural support structure, stability
3. **Leaning Position**: Dependence on support, rest
4. **Fallen Leaves**: Seasonal change, transition
5. **Natural Setting**: Connection to nature, outdoor environment

**Your Input**:
```
1. [Element name]: [Brief symbolic note]
2. [Element name]: [Brief symbolic note]
3. [Element name]: [Brief symbolic note]
4. [Element name]: [Brief symbolic note]
5. [Element name]: [Brief symbolic note]
```

---

### 1.3 Symbolic Meanings (For each element above)

**What this is**: The metaphorical or symbolic significance each visual element can represent.

**Guidelines**:
- Each element can have multiple symbolic meanings
- Think universally - what would this mean across cultures?
- Connect to human experiences (emotions, relationships, transitions, growth)
- Stay open to multiple interpretations
- Think both literally and metaphorically

**Best Practices**:
✅ DO: "Bicycle: Journey, movement, progress, self-propulsion, balance"
❌ DON'T: "Bicycle: Just a bike, means nothing special"

**Example from Bicycle Tree Card**:
- **Bicycle**: Journey, movement, progress, personal transportation, self-propulsion, balance
- **Tree**: Support, stability, strength, natural foundation, growth, roots
- **Leaning**: Need for support, rest, dependence, trust, temporary pause
- **Leaves**: Change, transition, seasons, letting go, natural cycles
- **Natural Setting**: Connection to environment, grounding, simplicity, authenticity

**Your Input**:
```
Element 1 - [Name]: [List 3-5 symbolic meanings separated by commas]

Element 2 - [Name]: [List 3-5 symbolic meanings separated by commas]

Element 3 - [Name]: [List 3-5 symbolic meanings separated by commas]

Element 4 - [Name]: [List 3-5 symbolic meanings separated by commas]

Element 5 - [Name]: [List 3-5 symbolic meanings separated by commas]
```

---

## Part 2: Theme Development

Now transform symbolic meanings into 5 distinct reflection themes.

### Theme Selection Strategy

**Progressive Depth**: Your 5 themes should create a journey:
1. **Theme 1**: Accessible, relatable entry point
2. **Theme 2**: Slightly deeper, more personal
3. **Theme 3**: Emotional or relational dimension
4. **Theme 4**: Challenge or growth opportunity
5. **Theme 5**: Integration or higher perspective

**Diversity**: Vary themes across different life dimensions:
- Relationships (self, others, environment)
- Time (past, present, future)
- Action (reflection, change, commitment)
- Scope (individual, interpersonal, systemic)

---

### Reflection Theme #1 *REQUIRED* | Max 500 characters

**What this is**: Your first, most accessible reflection that connects visual element to personal insight.

**Structure to Follow**:
**[Theme Name]**: The [visual element] can symbolize [concept]. Reflect on [personal aspect]. [Open-ended question]?

**Guidelines**:
- **Theme Name**: Descriptive, clear, 2-5 words (e.g., "Balance and Stability")
- **Visual Element**: Specific object from the image
- **Concept**: Universal symbolic meaning
- **Personal Aspect**: How this relates to the user's life
- **Question**: Open-ended, inviting, non-judgmental
- Character limit: 0/500

**Best Practices**:
✅ DO: "**Balance and Stability**: The bicycle leaning against the tree can symbolize the support systems in our lives. Reflect on the relationships and structures that provide you stability. Who or what do you lean on when life feels unbalanced?"

❌ DON'T: "**Being Stable**: The bike needs the tree. Do you have support? You should find someone to lean on."

**Why this example works**:
- Clear theme name
- Specific visual element (bicycle + tree)
- Universal concept (support systems)
- Personal connection (your stability sources)
- Open-ended question (who/what, not yes/no)
- Non-judgmental tone (invites exploration)

**Your Input**:
```
**[Theme Name]**: 







```

---

### Reflection Theme #2 *REQUIRED* | Max 500 characters

**What this is**: Second reflection, going slightly deeper or exploring different dimension.

**Guidelines**:
- Follow same structure as Theme #1
- Choose a different visual element or aspect
- Explore a different dimension than Theme #1
- Maintain open-ended question style
- Progress slightly deeper in intimacy or challenge
- Character limit: 0/500

**Best Practices**:
✅ DO: "**Hidden Potential**: The bicycle is partially obscured by the tree, suggesting parts not immediately visible. Consider aspects of yourself that might be hidden or not fully expressed. What potential within you is waiting to be uncovered?"

❌ DON'T: "**You're Hidden**: The bike is hiding. Are you hiding too? Stop hiding and show yourself."

**Your Input**:
```
**[Theme Name]**: 







```

---

### Reflection Theme #3 *REQUIRED* | Max 500 characters

**What this is**: Third reflection, exploring emotional or relational dimensions.

**Guidelines**:
- Follow same structure as previous themes
- Explore emotional, relational, or temporal aspects
- May introduce tension or complexity
- Maintain supportive, non-judgmental tone
- Can connect to change, transition, or growth
- Character limit: 0/500

**Best Practices**:
✅ DO: "**Seasons of Change**: The fallen leaves indicate transition from one season to another. Reflect on the changes happening in your life. How do you feel about the current phase you're in, and what transitions are you experiencing?"

❌ DON'T: "**Change Happens**: Leaves fall. Things change. Is change happening to you? Just accept it and move on."

**Your Input**:
```
**[Theme Name]**: 







```

---

### Reflection Theme #4 *REQUIRED* | Max 500 characters

**What this is**: Fourth reflection, inviting action, growth, or facing challenges.

**Guidelines**:
- Follow same structure as previous themes
- Invite consideration of action or change
- May present gentle challenge or growth opportunity
- Balance challenge with support
- Connect insight to potential movement
- Character limit: 0/500

**Best Practices**:
✅ DO: "**Journey and Movement**: A bicycle represents progress on a personal path. Think about the journey you are on in life. Where are you headed, and what steps are you taking to move forward? What obstacles might you need to navigate?"

❌ DON'T: "**Moving Forward**: Bikes move. Are you moving forward in life? You need to start pedaling and stop being lazy."

**Your Input**:
```
**[Theme Name]**: 







```

---

### Reflection Theme #5 *REQUIRED* | Max 500 characters

**What this is**: Fifth reflection, integrating insights or offering broader perspective.

**Guidelines**:
- Follow same structure as previous themes
- Offer integration, synthesis, or higher perspective
- May connect individual to larger context (nature, community, purpose)
- Leave user with sense of possibility and wholeness
- Complete the journey from Themes 1-4
- Character limit: 0/500

**Best Practices**:
✅ DO: "**Connection to Nature**: The presence of the tree and leaves connects the bicycle to the natural environment. Reflect on your relationship with the world around you and how it influences your well-being. How might deepening this connection support your journey?"

❌ DON'T: "**Go Outside**: The bike is outside with a tree. Do you go outside enough? You really should go outside more often."

**Your Input**:
```
**[Theme Name]**: 







```

---

## Part 3: Context Adaptation

**Your Input** (provide 2-3 adapted reflections that benefit most from therapy framing):
```
Theme [#]: 
Therapy Adaptation: 



Theme [#]:
Therapy Adaptation:



```

```
[List any culture-specific elements, concepts that may need localization, or themes that might 
require alternative framings for different cultural contexts]

Example: "The concept of 'work-life balance' in Theme #5 varies significantly across cultures. 
In collectivist cultures, may need reframing to emphasize family/community harmony rather than 
individual balance."





```

**Suggested Adaptations**:
```
[Provide alternative framings or notes for translators/cultural consultants]

Example: "For cultures with strong collectivist values, consider reframing support questions to 
include family and community networks more explicitly."




```

---

### 5.3 Character Expansion Planning

**Your reflection prompts must work in all 5 languages**:
