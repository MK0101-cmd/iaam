**Your Input**:
```
Powerful for: Life transitions (career change, relationship shifts, relocation), decision-making moments, identity exploration, fear work, courage building, change management, rites of passage. Especially effective when someone is "stuck at the threshold."
```
[Annotation: Specific contexts where metaphor resonates, under 300 characters]

### 3.2 Pairing Suggestions | Max 200 characters

**What this is**: Cards or contexts that pair well with this one.

**Your Input**:
```
Pairs beautifully with FLOW "In Between" topics, photo cards showing doors/edges/horizons, question cards about courage or change. Works in any journey-focused program.

## Part 4: Multilingual Considerations

### 4.1 Translation Notes | Max 200 characters

**What this is**: Important considerations for translating this card.

**Your Input**:

```
[Annotation: Notes dual meaning requires preservation in translation]

### 4.2 Cultural Sensitivity | Max 200 characters

**What this is**: Cultural considerations for this card.

**Your Input**:

---

## Part 5: Integration

### 5.1 Combines Well With

**This card works particularly well with** (checked all):
- [x] Thematic/photo cards - especially doors, paths, edges, horizons
- [ ] FACES cards
- [x] FLOW topics - "In Between" series perfectly aligned
- [x] Canvas activities - transition and change activities
- [x] Journey programs - any journey about change or transition
- [x] Workshop exercises - transformation and growth workshops
- [x] One-on-one coaching - decision-making and life transition coaching
- [x] Team facilitation - organizational change contexts

[Annotation: Universal metaphor works across many POY contexts]

### 5.2 4-Step Process Application

**How this card supports each step**:

**Pause** | Max 100 characters:
```
"Threshold" naturally invites pause - it's a stopping point, a moment of consideration before crossing.
```

**Expand** | Max 100 characters:
```
Expands awareness of the in-between space - what's on both sides, what crossing means, what staying means.
```

**Focus** | Max 100 characters:
```
Focuses on the specific threshold - naming it clearly, understanding what makes it significant.
```

**Act** | Max 100 characters:
```
Threshold implies action choice - cross or don't cross, step forward or step back, or wait here mindfully.
```

[Annotation: Word naturally supports all four steps of POY process]

## üí° USAGE EXAMPLE IN SESSION

### Scenario: Group Workshop on Life Transitions

**Context**: Workshop for people navigating major life changes (career, relationship, location, identity)

**Facilitator**: "We're going to work with a word today. [Places card in center of circle] The word is 'Threshold.' Take a moment to just be with this word. What does it bring up for you?"

**[10 seconds of silence - participants looking at word]**

**Participant 1**: "I'm standing at a threshold. I've been offered a job in another city. I want to go but I'm terrified to leave what's familiar."

**Participant 2**: "Threshold makes me think of my daughter going to college next month. I'm at the threshold of being an empty nester. I don't know who I am without kids at home."

**Participant 3**: "I'm at the threshold of coming out to my family. I've been standing here for months, one foot raised, unable to step."

**Facilitator**: "Beautiful. Notice how threshold is a place - you can stand at it. It's not about being on one side or the other. It's about being in this particular place, this in-between space. Let's explore what it's like to be at your threshold."

**[Pairs work with threshold questions: What's behind you? What's ahead? What's the fear? What's the pull? What would crossing require? What does staying at the threshold give you?]**

**Participant 3** [sharing later]: "I realized I've been treating the threshold like a problem - like I should have crossed already. But maybe the threshold itself is important. Maybe I'm gathering courage here. Maybe crossing happens when it's time, not when I force it."

**Facilitator**: "Yes. The threshold has its own wisdom. It's the place where we prepare, where we feel the weight of what we're stepping toward. Honoring the threshold is different from being stuck. Who here is honoring your threshold rather than rushing yourself?"

**[Multiple hands raise, visible shifts in body language from tension to acceptance]**

**Why This Works**:
- Single word generates rich personal meaning for each person
- Metaphor gives language for liminal experience
- Facilitator normalizes threshold as a place to be, not just a line to cross
- Group shares different threshold experiences, reducing isolation
- Reframe from "stuck" to "honoring the threshold" shifts shame to wisdom
- Physical placement of card in center creates focal point

## üí° ALTERNATIVE USAGE EXAMPLES

### One-on-One Coaching: Decision-Making

**Usage**: Client place word card physically on table. Facilitator asks: "If this threshold could speak, what would it ask of you?" Client engages with word as entity, receives insight from their own metaphorical thinking.

### Canvas Work: Personal Transition Map

**Usage**: "Threshold" placed at center of canvas. Client draws or places cards representing: what's behind the threshold, what's beyond it, what stands at the threshold with them, what crossing would require, what staying offers. Creates visual map of transition.

### Team Facilitation: Organizational Change

**Usage**: Team identifies organizational threshold they're facing. Explores collectively: Who is ready to cross? Who needs more time? What does the team need to cross together? What might be lost/gained? Creates shared language for change process.

[Annotation: Shows versatility across different POY applications]

## üí° KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS EXAMPLE

**What Makes This Word Card Strong**:
1. **Rich metaphorical potential** - single word holds multiple layers of meaning
2. **Universal yet personal** - everyone has thresholds, each one unique
3. **Spatial and temporal** - works as place and as moment
4. **Emotionally resonant** - threshold moments are significant, tender
5. **Neutral valence** - not positive or negative, allowing projection
6. **Action-implied** - threshold suggests movement (or conscious non-movement)
7. **Culturally significant** - threshold crossing recognized across cultures

**Word Selection Principles Demonstrated**:
- **Concrete + Abstract**: Physical doorway AND metaphorical passage
- **Single word power**: One word can generate 30-minute exploration
- **Multiple meanings**: Word works at different levels simultaneously
- **Metaphor-rich**: Strong visual imagery inherent in word
- **Experience-accessible**: Everyone has threshold experiences

**Facilitation Principles Demonstrated**:
- **Let word speak**: Don't over-explain, let participants project meaning
- **Silence first**: Give time for word to land before asking anything
- **Open questions**: "What does this bring up?" not "This means X"
- **Honor variety**: Different interpretations are all valid
- **Use as entity**: "If threshold could speak..." creates dialogue

**Usage Across Contexts**:
- **Individual**: Deep personal exploration of specific transition
- **Pairs**: Sharing threshold stories creates connection
- **Group**: Collective exploration normalizes transition experience
- **Team**: Organizational thresholds require collective navigation
- **Canvas**: Visual representation of threshold space and components

**Cultural Adaptation Notes**:
- Acknowledge threshold crossing rituals in participant cultures
- Some cultures emphasize community in crossing; others individual courage
- Translation may use "liminal space," "passage," or "border" depending on language
- Universal concept but culturally specific expressions

**How to Use This as Your Guide**:
- Choose words with metaphorical depth, not just literal meaning
- Provide multiple interpretations showing word's range
- Test words in real sessions - note participant responses
- Show how single word can generate extensive exploration
- Demonstrate facilitation that honors participant's meaning-making
- Include diverse usage examples (individual, group, canvas, team)
- Address both literal and metaphorical translations
