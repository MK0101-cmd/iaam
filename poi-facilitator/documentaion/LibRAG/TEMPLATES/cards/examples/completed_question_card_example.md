```
Ideal for: Career transitions, entrepreneurial decisions, creative projects, personal growth challenges, team innovation sessions, leadership development. Works when people feel stuck by fear of failure or when risk-taking is needed.
```
[Annotation: Specific contexts listed, under 300 characters, shows versatility]

**What this is**: Cards or contexts that pair well with this one.

**Your Input**:
```
Pairs with photo cards showing leaps/journeys, FLOW topics on Risk or Courage, word cards like "Bold" or "Try". Works in journey programs about change.
```
[Annotation: Specific POY system connections, under 200 characters]

### 3.3 Facilitation Notes | Max 200 characters

**What this is**: Tips for facilitators using this card.

**Your Input**:
```

```
[Annotation: Practical facilitation guidance, includes follow-up question]

## Part 4: Multilingual Considerations

### 4.1 Translation Notes | Max 200 characters

**What this is**: Important considerations for translating this card.

**Examples**:
- For questions: Maintain open-ended structure in all languages
- For words: Some words don't translate directly; provide cultural equivalent

**Your Input**:
```
Keep "if you knew" conditional structure. "Dare" translates differently - ensure it maintains invitation not pressure. "Feedback" concept may need cultural contextualization.
```
[Annotation: Specific linguistic and cultural considerations for translators]

### 4.2 Cultural Sensitivity | Max 200 characters

**What this is**: Cultural considerations for this card.

**Your Input**:
```
Failure is stigmatized differently across cultures. In some contexts, frame as "learning" rather than "failure." Individual boldness valued more in individualist cultures.
```
[Annotation: Acknowledges cultural variation in failure concept and risk-taking]

## Part 5: Integration

### 5.1 Combines Well With

**This card works particularly well with** (checked all):
- [x] Thematic/photo cards - especially journey, leap, horizon images
- [ ] FACES cards
- [x] FLOW topics - Risk, Courage, Dream, More
- [x] Canvas activities - vision-focused activities
- [x] Journey programs - change and transition journeys
- [x] Workshop exercises - innovation and creativity workshops
- [x] One-on-one coaching - goal-setting and breakthrough sessions
- [x] Team facilitation - team innovation and risk-taking

[Annotation: Versatile card, works across many POY contexts]

### 5.2 4-Step Process Application

**How this card supports each step**:

**Pause** | Max 100 characters:
```
Question itself creates pause - stops automatic "I can't" response and invites fresh thinking.
```

**Expand** | Max 100 characters:
```
Expands possibility - reframes failure as feedback, opens up new options previously dismissed by fear.
```

**Focus** | Max 100 characters:
```
Focuses on action - "what would you DO" directs toward concrete possibilities and next steps.
```

**Act** | Max 100 characters:
```
Natural bridge to action - once possibility opens, asking "what's your first step?" flows naturally.
```

[Annotation: Shows how question supports complete POY process]

## üí° USAGE EXAMPLE IN SESSION

### Scenario: One-on-One Career Coaching

**Context**: Client is unhappy in current job but afraid to make a change

**Facilitator**: "I'd like to offer you a question. [Shows card] Take a moment to read it..."

**Client**: [Reads silently] "What would you dare to do if you knew that failure was simply feedback on the path to success?"

**Facilitator**: [Pauses for 7 seconds, maintains grounded presence]

**Client**: [After pause] "Wow. I... I would start my own consulting practice. I've been thinking about it for three years but I'm terrified of failing."

**Facilitator**: "You would start your own consulting practice. Tell me more about that."

**Client**: "If I really believed failure was just feedback... then trying and learning would be the point, not some perfect success. I could just... try. Small. See what happens."

**Facilitator**: "If failure is feedback on the path, what's one small step you could take to start receiving that feedback?"

**Client**: "I could reach out to three potential clients and offer a pilot project. Free or low-cost. See what they need, how I work with them. That's not scary - that's just learning."

**Why This Works**:
- Question reframes failure from threat to tool
- Pause allows the reframe to land
- Client moves from "I can't" to "I could" to "I will"
- Facilitator uses client's language ("feedback") in follow-up
- Small first step emerges naturally from the possibility opening

## üí° KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS EXAMPLE

**What Makes This Question Card Strong**:
1. **Reframes limiting belief** - turns failure from stop sign to stepping stone
2. **Universally applicable** - works for any context where fear blocks action
3. **Action-oriented** - "what would you DO" points toward concrete steps
4. **Emotionally resonant** - "dare" acknowledges the courage needed
5. **Open-ended structure** - infinite possible answers
6. **Brief yet powerful** - 117 characters pack philosophical punch
7. **Integrates well** - works across POY methods and contexts

**Question Design Principles Demonstrated**:
- **Positive presupposition**: Assumes failure leads somewhere useful
- **Invitation not interrogation**: "Dare" invites, doesn't demand
- **Conditional opens possibility**: "If you knew" creates safe space for imagination
- **Action verb**: "Do" directs toward concrete thinking
- **No judgment**: Question doesn't imply you should or shouldn't

**Facilitation Principles Demonstrated**:
- **Pause is essential**: 5-10 seconds after question
- **Presence over words**: Facilitator holds space, doesn't rush
- **Use client language**: Mirror their words back ("feedback")
- **Bridge to action**: Follow-up question moves to concrete step
- **Small steps**: Don't push for big leap, find the small first step

**How to Use This as Your Guide**:
- Design questions that reframe limiting beliefs positively
- Keep language simple and powerful (avoid complexity)
- Test questions in real sessions and note what works
- Provide facilitation guidance beyond just the question
- Show cultural and translation considerations
- Include real usage example with observable impact
