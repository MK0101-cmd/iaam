## Part 3: Detailed Process

### 3.1 Step-by-Step Instructions *REQUIRED*

**Setup** (Duration: 1 min)

```
**Facilitator Says**: 
"We're going to take 15 minutes to appreciate each other. We move fast in our work and often don't pause to notice the contributions people are making. Let's pause now."

**Materials Needed**: 
- The Coaching Game photo cards (1 card per participant + extras)
- Cards spread where all can browse

**Room Setup**: 
- Team seated in circle if possible (seeing each other matters)
- Photo cards spread on table or floor where all can access
```

**Step 1: Card Selection** (Duration: 4 min)

```
**Facilitator Instructions**:
"Look at these cards. Choose ONE card that represents someone on this team - their contribution, their way of being, something you appreciate about them. Take your time. Choose the person first, then find the card that represents what you appreciate."

**Participants Do**:
- Browse photo cards silently
- Select one card that represents their appreciation for a specific team member
- Return to seat with chosen card

**Key Facilitation Point**: 
Silence during selection allows for authentic choice, not reactive selection
```

**Step 2: Appreciation Sharing - Round 1** (Duration: 8 min for team of 8)

```
**Facilitator Instructions**:
"We'll go around the circle. Share:
1. Who you chose
2. What you appreciate about them (specific recent example if possible)
3. How this card represents that appreciation

Keep it to 1 minute each. Who wants to start?"

**Participants Do**:
- One at a time, hold up their card
- Name the team member they're appreciating
- Share specific appreciation with concrete example
- Explain how card represents this

**Example**:
"I chose this card [mountain climber] for Maria. Last week when the client changed requirements again, Maria stayed calm and helped us all see a path forward. She didn't panic or complain - she problem-solved. This card represents her steady determination. Thank you, Maria."

**Recipient Response**:
- Simply say "Thank you" (no need to deflect or minimize)
- Can show appreciation physically (nod, hand on heart)

**Key Facilitation Points**: 
- Keep shares to ~1 minute (gentle time management)
- Encourage SPECIFIC examples, not generic "you're great"
- Ensure recipient receives fully (doesn't deflect)
- If someone not mentioned yet, facilitator can appreciate them OR save for Step 3
```

**Step 3: Ensuring Everyone Received** (Duration: 2 min)

```
**Facilitator Check**:
"Has everyone received at least one appreciation? [Pause, look around] If not, take 2 minutes - who else wants to appreciate someone?"

**Participants Do**:
- Volunteer additional appreciations if anyone missed
- Keep brief (30 seconds each)

**Facilitator Backup**:
If someone still not mentioned, facilitator offers genuine appreciation OR invites: "What do YOU appreciate about your own contributions this week?" (self-appreciation valid)

**Key Facilitation Point**: 
Everyone needs to receive something - don't end if someone got zero appreciation
```

**Closing** (Duration: 1 min) (optional)

```
**Facilitator Says**:
"Notice how this feels. When we take 15 minutes to see and name each other's contributions, something shifts. Let's carry this into our work together. Thank you."

**Optional**: 
"What's different in the room now compared to 15 minutes ago?" (quick popcorn responses)

**Key Facilitation Point**: 
Keep closing brief - the appreciations ARE the integration
```

[Annotation: Complete step-by-step process with timing, instructions, what participants do, examples, and facilitation tips]

### 3.2 Facilitator Script/Language *REQUIRED* | Max 400 characters

**Your Input**:
```
**Opening**: "Pause work. Take 15 min to appreciate each other. Choose a card representing someone's contribution."

**During**: [Keep time gently] "Let's keep moving - 1 minute each." [If generic] "Can you give a specific example?"

**If someone missed**: "Who hasn't received appreciation yet? Let's ensure everyone's seen."

**Closing**: "Something shifted. Carry this forward."
```
[Annotation: Concise language templates under 400 characters]

### 3.3 POY Method/Tool *REQUIRED*

**This building block uses** (check all):
- [x] The Coaching Game (photo cards as appreciation catalyst)
- [ ] FACES cards
- [ ] FLOW system
- [ ] Canvas
- [ ] Question cards
- [ ] Word cards
- [x] Circle practice (sitting in circle for sharing)
- [x] Structured sharing protocol
- [ ] Other: _______________

[Annotation: Primary tool is photo cards in circle practice structure]

---

## Part 4: Integration & Adaptation

### 4.1 Connects With *REQUIRED*

**This building block works well before**:
```
- Strategic planning session (appreciations build goodwill before hard conversations)
- Conflict resolution meeting (reminds team of strengths before addressing issues)
- Team goal-setting (grounds goals in actual team capacities)
- Creative brainstorming (positive energy fuels creativity)
```

**This building block works well after**:
```
- Challenging project completion (celebrate contributions)
- Difficult feedback session (balance hard feedback with appreciation)
- Team conflict (rebuild connection after tension)
- Stressful period (restore team morale)
```

**Can be combined with**:
```
- Any team meeting structure
- Other POY building blocks (Powerful Questions, Energy Check)
- Performance review processes (quarterly appreciation rituals)
```

[Annotation: Shows strategic placement in various team contexts]

### 4.2 Standalone Capability

**Can this building block work standalone?**
- [x] Yes - works perfectly as standalone practice
- [ ] No - requires larger context
- [ ] Partial - needs some framing

**If standalone, how to frame it**:
```
Position as "team connection practice" or "appreciation ritual." No extensive setup needed. Can become regular team practice (monthly team appreciation day). Works as drop-in at any team meeting. Self-contained value.
```
[Annotation: Highly standalone - one of its strengths]

### 4.3 Repetition & Variation

**Can this be repeated?**
- [x] Yes, multiple times with same group

**If repeated, how to vary**:
```
- Variation 1: "Appreciate someone OUTSIDE our immediate team who helped us"
- Variation 2: "Appreciate someone for a QUALITY, not an action" (their presence, their energy, their way of being)
- Variation 3: "Appreciate yourself - choose card for your own contribution" (self-appreciation)
- Variation 4: "Appreciate the person to your RIGHT" (ensures distribution)
- Variation 5: Written appreciations left at desks (for remote/async teams)

**Frequency**: 
- Weekly: Too much, feels forced
- Monthly: Sweet spot for most teams
- Quarterly: Works for larger organizations
- After significant milestones: Always appropriate
```
[Annotation: Multiple variations keep practice fresh over time]

## Part 5: Facilitation Guidance

### 5.1 Facilitation Tips *REQUIRED* | Max 300 characters

**Your Input**:
```
**Time management crucial**: 1 min per person or bleeds over. **Specificity matters**: Push for examples, not generic praise. **Watch energy**: If someone gets zero appreciation, YOU appreciate them. **Model receiving**: Say "thank you" without deflecting. **Trust silence during selection**.
```
[Annotation: 299/300 characters, actionable tips]

### 5.2 Common Challenges *REQUIRED*

**Challenge 1**:
```
**Challenge**: Same people get multiple appreciations, some get none (popularity contest dynamic)
**Prevention**: After first round, ask "Who hasn't been appreciated yet?" and create space for them
**Solution**: Facilitator appreciates anyone who received zero. OR use Variation 4 (appreciate person to your right) to ensure distribution
**Learning**: Some teams have visibility imbalances - this exercise surfaces them
```

**Challenge 2**:
```
**Challenge**: Appreciations too generic ("You're awesome!") without substance
**Prevention**: In instructions, emphasize "specific recent example"
**Solution**: When it happens, gently ask: "Can you give us a specific moment?" Model specificity in your own appreciation
**Learning**: Specific appreciations land deeper than generic praise
```

**Challenge 3**:
```
**Challenge**: Someone deflects or minimizes their appreciation ("Oh, it was nothing")
**Prevention**: In setup, say "When you receive appreciation, just say thank you - don't deflect"
**Solution**: If it happens, gently intervene: "Just receive it. You deserve this acknowledgment."
**Learning**: Many people struggle to receive - this is practice
```

[Annotation: Three realistic challenges with multi-level solutions]

### 5.3 Cultural/Context Sensitivity | Max 300 characters

**Your Input**:
```
**Public praise**: Some cultures uncomfortable with spotlight - offer written variation. **Hierarchy**: In hierarchical cultures, may need manager to go first to model vulnerability. **Gender**: Watch for women getting "nice" appreciations, men getting "competent" - address imbalance. **Remote**: Adapt for virtual (Variation 5).
```
[Annotation: Important cultural considerations under 300 characters]

---

## Part 6: Materials & Setup

### 6.1 Materials Needed *REQUIRED*

```

**General Supplies**:
```
- [ ] Timer (for facilitator time management)
- [ ] Optional: Journal/paper if participants want to note appreciations received
```

**Space Requirements**:
```

```
[Annotation: Observable immediate changes under 200 characters]

### 7.2 Longer-Term Impact | Max 200 characters

**Your Input**:
```

```
[Annotation: Cumulative effects of regular practice]

### 7.3 Metrics/Assessment | Max 200 characters

**Your Input**:
```

## Part 8: Examples & Use Cases

### 8.1 Real-World Example 1 *REQUIRED*

**Context**: 
```
Engineering team of 10, high stress from product launch, tensions high, lots of blame after bugs discovered
```

**How building block was used**:
```
Team lead opened tense retrospective meeting with Appreciation Exchange. Engineers resistant at first ("We don't have time for this"), but team lead insisted. After 15 minutes of appreciations - including debugging heroics, late-night support, creative problem-solving - the room softened. One engineer teared up: "I didn't know anyone noticed." The retrospective that followed was constructive instead of blame-filled.
```

**Outcome**:
```
Meeting went from defensive to collaborative. Issues addressed without personal attacks. Team requested this become monthly practice. "Changed how we relate to each other" per team lead.
```

[Annotation: High-stress technical team context with transformative result]

### 8.2 Real-World Example 2 *REQUIRED*

**Context**:
```
Hospital nursing team, 15 people, pandemic burnout extreme, turnover threatening, morale at all-time low
```

**How building block was used**:
```
Nurse manager instituted monthly "Appreciation Day" using this building block at end of shift meeting. First time, some eye-rolls. But when one nurse appreciated another for "talking me off the ledge after that patient death," something broke open. Appreciations got real - the small acts that kept each other going. Cards helped them say what they couldn't say directly.
```

**Outcome**:
```
After 3 months, team cohesion visibly stronger. Turnover stabilized. Nurses reported "feeling less alone." Manager attributes retention to feeling seen. Simple 15-min practice, massive impact.
```

[Annotation: Healthcare burnout context showing power of consistent practice]

### 8.3 Real-World Example 3 *REQUIRED*

**Context**:
```
Corporate team, 8 people, new team just formed (merger), don't know each other well, awkward dynamics
```

**How building block was used**:
```
Team facilitator used Appreciation Exchange at end of first team retreat. "But we barely know each other!" True, but after 2 days together, they'd seen things. The appreciations were based on observations from retreat - "I noticed you listened really carefully," "You asked the question I was afraid to ask." Cards gave new team language to see each other's early contributions.
```

**Outcome**:
```
Set tone for appreciative team culture from day one. Became ritual at every monthly team meeting. New team members get first appreciation at their first meeting (welcome practice). "Differentiates us from other teams," per team member.
```

[Annotation: New team context - building culture from start]

## Part 9: Variations

### 9.1 Variation 1: "Appreciation for Someone Outside Our Team"

**When to use**: When team collaborated with other teams, vendors, stakeholders

**Adaptation**:
```
"Choose a card for someone OUTSIDE our team who helped us recently. Who and why?"

Benefits: 
- Expands gratitude beyond immediate circle
- Recognizes cross-functional support
- Builds organizational culture beyond single team
- Can share with other team ("Hey, my team appreciated you today")

Example:
"This card for IT support - Jorge stayed until 8pm to fix our server issue before the client demo."
```

[Annotation: Expands appreciation beyond team boundaries]

### 9.2 Variation 2: "Self-Appreciation"

**When to use**: When team has imposter syndrome, perfectionism, self-criticism patterns

**Adaptation**:
```
"Choose a card representing YOUR OWN contribution this week/month. What did YOU bring?"

Benefits:
- Practices self-recognition (many people struggle with this)
- Surfaces individual contributions in collective work
- Builds self-esteem
- Models healthy self-appreciation

Important: Frame as strength practice, not narcissism. "We're good at appreciating others, less good at appreciating ourselves. Practice now."

Example:
"This card [person planting seeds] for me - I initiated the conversation we'd been avoiding. Planted seed for change."
```

[Annotation: Powerful variation for self-critical teams]

### 9.3 Variation 3: "Silent Appreciation"

**When to use**: Virtual teams, asynchronous work, written culture, introverts

**Adaptation**:
```
Instead of verbal sharing in circle:
- Each person writes appreciation on card/sticky note
- Delivers to colleague's desk/emails
- Person receives multiple written appreciations to read privately

Benefits:
- Works for remote/distributed teams
- Less pressure for introverts
- Appreciations can be kept and re-read
- Asynchronous (doesn't require everyone present)

Trade-off: Loses collective witness energy, but gains permanence
```

[Annotation: Adapts for remote/async/introverted contexts]
