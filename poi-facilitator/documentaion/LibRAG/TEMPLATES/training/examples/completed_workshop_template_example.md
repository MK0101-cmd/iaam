### 3.3 Facilitation Flow Notes *REQUIRED* | Max 600 characters

**Your Input**:
```
**Energy Arc**: Start warm/welcoming, build to generative/creative in Module 4 (post-break peak energy), focus/narrow in Module 5, close with grounded integration. 

**Pacing**: Modules 2-3 build foundation (80 min) - don't rush. Module 4 is heart (50 min) - protect this time. Module 5 must not be rushed or participants leave with insight but no action.

**Flexibility**: If group needs more time in Module 2 (rich stories), can compress Module 3 to 30 min. Canvas time (Module 4) is non-negotiable - need full 25 min for creation.
```

### 5.1 Facilitator Preparation *REQUIRED* | Max 400 characters

**Your Input**:
```
**Required background**: POY certification, coaching or facilitation experience with career topics, comfort holding emotion (transitions can be tender).

**Prep time**: 3 hours (review materials, prepare space, customize intro to group, test materials).

**Mindset**: You're creating space for discovery, not providing answers. Trust the process and the cards. Your presence matters more than your expertise.
```
[Annotation: Clear facilitator requirements and mindset orientation]

### 5.2 Opening Framework *REQUIRED* | Max 500 characters

**Your Input**:
```
"Welcome. Career transitions - by choice or by circumstance - are some of life's most significant crossroads. Today we're creating space to pause, reflect, and gain clarity about what's next. We'll use Points of You - cards and creative methods - to access your wisdom. Not my answers, YOUR answers. The cards are mirrors. You'll explore strengths, values, possibilities, and create a plan. You'll leave with more clarity than you came with. Ready? Let's begin with introductions."
```
[Annotation: Welcoming, clear on what will happen, sets expectations, under 500 characters]

### 5.3 Module-by-Module Facilitation Tips *REQUIRED*

**Module 1: Welcome**
```
**Tips**: 
- Start on time even if people still arriving (honors those who are on time)
- Keep intro round efficient (name, situation, one word for how they're feeling - not long stories)
- Working agreements: offer starter list but invite additions from group
- Watch for "helper" in room who wants to solve everyone's problems - reinforce "no advice-giving" agreement

**Watch for**: Someone sharing crisis (job loss today, etc.) - acknowledge privately at break if needs different support
```

**Module 2: Mining Professional Gold**
```
**Tips**:
- Give full 10 minutes for card browsing - some people need time
- In pair share, remind: focus on STORIES, not job titles
- Listen for: verbs, energy shifts, what they were creating/building/enabling
- When harvesting strengths, write on flip chart - makes it real
- If someone says "I don't know my strengths," ask pair partner to reflect back what they heard

**Watch for**: Resume recitation instead of stories - redirect to specific moment
```

**Module 3: Values Clarification**
```
**Tips**:
- Some people will struggle to narrow to 5 values - that's okay, can have 6-7
- The "misalignment" question can bring up emotion - this is good, honor it
- Small group sharing builds intimacy - keep groups to 3-4 max
- If someone discovers major misalignment, validate: "This awareness is the first step"

**Watch for**: "Should" values (I should value family) vs. actual values - gently challenge
```

**Module 4: Envisioning Possibilities**
```
**Tips**:
- Emphasize: doesn't need to be pretty, symbolic okay, stick figures fine
- Play gentle music during creation time if helpful
- Resist temptation to "help" - let their vision emerge
- The rating exercise (1-10 on excitement/feasibility/values) reveals gut wisdom
- If someone stuck: "Don't overthink, just put marker to paper and see what comes"

**Watch for**: Perfectionism blocking creativity - give permission to be "bad at art"
```

**Module 5: Decision & Action**
```
**Tips**:
- "Experiment, not commitment" language crucial - reduces pressure
- 30-day timeframe keeps it concrete and manageable
- Question cards often surface hidden obstacles/resources - explore what comes up
- Accountability partnerships work best when both people commit to specific check-in date
- First step must be VERY specific (not "research options" but "email 3 people for informational interviews")

**Watch for**: Analysis paralysis - help them choose direction to explore, not commit to forever
```

**Module 6: Integration**
```
**Tips**:
- Keep closing brief - people are tired but also energized
- One-word/one-card checkout prevents long processing (already did that)
- Ensure every accountability pair exchanged contact info before leaving
- End on hopeful note: "You have everything you need to take your next steps"

**Watch for**: Someone wanting to process more - offer to connect after, don't extend for whole group
```

[Annotation: Detailed module-specific guidance with common challenges and solutions]

### 5.4 Common Challenges *REQUIRED*

**Challenge 1: Participant in Active Crisis**
```
**Situation**: Someone just lost job this week, very raw emotion, overwhelming the space
**Prevention**: In marketing, note workshop is for "reflection and planning" not crisis intervention
**In-the-moment**: Acknowledge their pain, create space for emotion, check at break if they need different support (referral to career counselor/therapist), invite them to participate at their capacity
**Follow-up**: Provide resources, possibly follow-up call to check in
```

**Challenge 2: Participant Wants THE Answer**
```
**Situation**: "Just tell me what I should do" - wants facilitator to solve it
**Prevention**: Opening clearly states "your answers, not mine"
**In-the-moment**: "The cards and the process will help you find YOUR answer. What are the cards showing you?" Redirect to their wisdom repeatedly.
**Why it works**: Most people discover more commitment to path they chose vs. one they were told
```

**Challenge 3: Participants Skip Visual/Creative Work**
```
**Situation**: In Module 4, someone writes words instead of drawing/creating visually
**Prevention**: Emphasize in instructions that visual/creative accesses different knowing
**In-the-moment**: If early in creation time, gently encourage: "Try putting down the pen and picking up markers - what wants to be drawn?" If late, let it go - some people need words.
**Why it matters**: Visual bypasses over-thinking, but not worth forcing
```

**Challenge 4: Running Behind Schedule**
```
**Situation**: Module 2 rich stories, now 15 minutes behind
**Prevention**: Set timer alarms, keep opening efficient
**In-the-moment**: Compress Module 3 to 30 min (still workable), protect Module 4 and 5 time (non-negotiable for outcomes)
**What to cut**: Shorten group harvests, reduce small group processing time, tighten closing
```

[Annotation: Four realistic challenges with prevention and solutions]

## Part 7: Adaptations & Variations

### 7.1 Duration Variations *REQUIRED*

**2-Hour Version (compressed)**:
```
**What to keep**: Module 2 (strengths - 30 min), Module 4 (canvas - 40 min), Module 5 (action plan - 30 min), brief opening/closing (10 min each)
**What to cut**: Module 3 (values - integrate quickly into Module 2), extensive group sharing
**Trade-offs**: Less depth, less peer connection, still valuable for clarity
**Best for**: Corporate setting with time limits, teaser workshop, cost-conscious clients
```

**Full Day Version (expanded - 6 hours)**:
```
**What to add**: 
- Extended Module 2: Career lifeline exercise (map entire career visually)
- New Module 3.5: Limiting beliefs exploration (what's stopping you?)
- Extended Module 4: All 3 canvas options more fully developed
- New Module 5.5: Obstacle planning (if X happens, then Y)
- Extended closing: Action commitments shared with full group, celebration

**Benefits**: Much deeper exploration, stronger peer bonds, more thorough planning
**Best for**: Retreat setting, deeply committed participants, career coaches doing intensive
```

**Multi-Session Version (3 sessions x 2 hours)**:
```
**Session 1**: Modules 1-3 (welcome, strengths, values)
**Session 2**: Module 4 (envisioning), homework between: research 1 option
**Session 3**: Module 5-6 (refined action planning based on research, integration)

**Benefits**: Time to let insights percolate, homework deepens learning, accountability over time
**Best for**: Corporate L&D programs, cohort-based learning, ongoing groups
```

[Annotation: Three duration adaptations with clear trade-offs]

### 7.2 Group Size Adaptations *REQUIRED* | Max 400 characters

**Your Input**:
```
**1-on-1 coaching**: Use all modules, extend time for each (4-5 hours). Coach asks questions, witnesses fully. More depth per module.

**Small (4-7)**: Ideal. Full group sharing feasible, intimate, strong peer bonds.

**Medium (8-12)**: As designed. Some activities in small groups vs. full group.

**Large (13-20)**: Need co-facilitator. More small group work, less full group sharing. Extend by 30 min.
```
[Annotation: Clear guidance for different group sizes]

### 7.3 Virtual Delivery Adaptation *REQUIRED* | Max 600 characters

**Your Input**:
```
**Adaptations needed**:

- Breakout rooms for pair/small group work
- Longer breaks (screen fatigue)
- Ship physical workbook ahead OR digital workbook filled on screen
- Extend timeline by 15-20 min (tech transitions)

**What's harder virtually**: Energy reading, spontaneous connection, canvas creativity (tech barrier)
**What still works**: Card reflections, pair sharing, action planning
**Success factors**: Tech rehearsal, clear instructions, co-facilitator for tech support helpful
```
[Annotation: Realistic virtual adaptation with trade-offs noted]
