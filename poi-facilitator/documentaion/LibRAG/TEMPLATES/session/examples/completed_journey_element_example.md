---

## Part 3: Element Structure

### 3.1 Process Steps (Provide 3-5 steps) *REQUIRED*

**Step 1: Introduction & Card Selection** (Duration: 7 min)

```
**Facilitator**: "We're going to explore what matters most to you - your core values. These cards will help. Browse slowly and choose 3-5 cards that somehow speak to values you hold. Don't overthink - trust your gut."

**Participants**: Browse POY photo cards, select 3-5 that resonate with their values

**Key Point**: Intuitive selection honors unconscious knowing. Cards are catalysts, not answers.
```

**Step 2: Name the Values** (Duration: 8 min)

```
**Facilitator**: "Look at each card you chose. What value does it represent for you? Name it - one or two words." [If needed: "Courage? Connection? Freedom? Growth? Integrity? What word fits?"]

**Participants**: Identify and name the value each card represents (may write them down)

**Key Point**: The naming makes implicit explicit. Some may struggle - offer values word list if needed.
```

**Step 3: Explore Meaning** (Duration: 6 min)

```
**Facilitator**: "Pick one value that feels most important right now. What does this value mean to you specifically? How does it show up in your life?"

**Participants**: Reflect on one chosen value in depth - personal meaning and manifestation

**Key Point**: Generic values ("family," "success") need personal definition. What's YOUR version of this value?
```

**Step 4: Reality Check** (Duration: 4 min)

```
**Facilitator**: "Looking at your values, where are you honoring them? Where might you be compromising them?"

**Participants**: Assess alignment between stated values and actual life choices

**Key Point**: Gap between values and actions is information, not judgment. Creates growth edge.
```

**Step 5: Commitment** (Duration: 3 min) (optional)

```
**Facilitator**: "Choose one value. What's one small way you could honor it more fully this week?"

**Participants**: Identify specific action that aligns with chosen value

**Key Point**: Small, specific actions more powerful than big vague intentions.
```
[Annotation: Complete 5-step process, each with timing, facilitator guidance, participant action, key facilitation point]

## Part 4: Facilitation Guidance

### 4.1 Introduction | Max 300 characters

**Your Input**:
```
"Values are like a compass - they guide our decisions and define what matters. Today we'll identify yours. These cards will help - they're mirrors that reflect what's important to you. No right or wrong choices. Let's see what emerges."
```
[Annotation: 267/300 characters, warm introduction explaining metaphor and creating safety]

### 4.2 Facilitation Tips *REQUIRED* | Max 300 characters

**Your Input**:
```
**Have values word list ready** for those who struggle to name what they see. **Honor variety** - one person's "freedom," another's "structure" - all valid. **Watch for shoulds** - "I should value family" vs. actually valuing. **Don't interpret their cards** - they name the values, not you.
```
[Annotation: 298/300 characters, practical tips addressing common facilitation moments]

### 4.3 Common Challenge | Max 200 characters

**Your Input**:
```
**Challenge**: Participant picks "should" values (what they think they should value vs. what they do). **Solution**: Ask: "Is this a value you're living, or one you think you should have?"
```
[Annotation: Most common challenge with direct solution]

### 4.4 Transition Out | Max 200 characters

**Your Input**:
```
"You've identified your core values. These will be your compass as we continue this journey. We'll refer back to them as we explore [next element topic]."
```
[Annotation: Connects to journey continuation, establishes values as ongoing reference]

---

## Part 5: Materials & Setup

### 5.1 Materials Needed *REQUIRED*

- [ ] Word cards with values words (optional support)
```

**General Supplies**:
```
- [x] Paper or journal for notes
- [x] Pens/pencils
- [ ] Values word list (printed handout for reference)
```

**Participant Materials**:
```
- [ ] Values reflection worksheet (optional)
```
[Annotation: Minimal materials needed - primarily cards and note-taking supplies]

### 5.2 Setup Requirements | Max 200 characters

**Your Input**:
```
Spread 30-50 photo cards where all can browse (table or floor). Ensure good lighting so images clear. Have values word list available but not prominently displayed (use only if needed).
```
[Annotation: Simple setup focusing on card accessibility]

- Intention-setting element (values inform intentions)
```

**This element prepares for**:
```
- Goal-setting elements (goals should align with values)
- Decision-making elements (values guide decisions)
- Reflection elements (values are lens for reflection)
- Integration elements (checking values alignment throughout)
```
[Annotation: Shows how element fits into journey arc - what comes before/after]

### 6.2 Journey Integration *REQUIRED* | Max 300 characters

**Your Input**:
```
This element creates values foundation that subsequent journey elements build upon. Participants can reference their identified values throughout journey when making decisions, setting goals, or evaluating alignment. Values become touchstone for entire journey experience.
```
[Annotation: 284/300 characters, explains strategic placement and ongoing relevance]

### 6.3 Standalone Capability

**Can this element work standalone?**
- [x] Yes - works as standalone activity (great for workshops)
- [ ] No - requires journey context
- [ ] Partial - needs some adaptation

**If standalone, adaptation needed**:
```
If standalone: Add more context about why values matter and provide closing integration since won't be referenced later in journey. Extend time to 35 minutes for fuller experience.
```
[Annotation: Element is flexible - works standalone with minor adaptation]

## üí° USAGE EXAMPLE IN JOURNEY PROGRAM

### Scenario: Leadership Development Journey - Session 1, Element 2

**Context**: 12 mid-level managers in 2-day leadership journey. This is second element (after opening/introductions), establishing values foundation for leadership exploration.

**Journey Arc Context**: 
- Element 1 (previous): Welcome & Journey Overview (15 min)
- **Element 2 (this one): Values Check-In** (25 min)
- Element 3 (next): Leadership Challenges Exploration (40 min)

**How It Unfolds**:

**[7 min] Step 1 - Card Selection**:
Facilitator spreads 40 photo cards on table. "Browse these. Choose 3-5 that speak to what matters most to you as a leader." Managers browse, some quickly selecting, others deliberating. All eventually select 3-5 cards.

**[8 min] Step 2 - Naming**:
Facilitator: "Look at your first card. What value does it represent?" 

Manager A: [Holds card of mountain climber] "Perseverance. Not giving up."

Manager B: [Holds card of people in circle] "Collaboration. We're stronger together."

Manager C: [Holds card of single tree] "Authenticity. Being myself, not what others expect."

All 12 managers name 3-5 values each. Facilitator offers values word list to two managers who struggle with naming.

**[6 min] Step 3 - Explore Meaning**:
Facilitator: "Pick one value that feels most important right now. What does it mean specifically to you?"

Manager B: "Collaboration for me means... [pauses]... it means I stop trying to have all the answers. It means trusting my team's expertise. It means asking 'what do you think?' instead of telling."

[Others reflect silently or pair-share their value meanings]

**[4 min] Step 4 - Reality Check**:
Facilitator: "Where are you honoring your values? Where compromising?"

Manager C: "I said authenticity. But I realized I'm not being authentic. I'm performing 'manager' instead of being myself. I'm compromising this value constantly."

Several others nod recognition - gaps between stated values and lived reality surfacing.

**[3 min] Step 5 - Commitment** (optional but used):
Facilitator: "One value. One small action this week."

Manager C: "Authenticity. This week, I'll share a real struggle with my team instead of pretending I have it together."

Manager A: "Perseverance. I'll stick with that difficult conversation I've been avoiding."

**Transition to Element 3**:
Facilitator: "You've identified your values. Keep these cards visible. As we explore leadership challenges next, notice where your values guide you, where they're challenged, and where they give you strength. Your values are your leadership compass."

**Why This Works in Journey Context**:
- Creates foundation for all subsequent leadership exploration
- Participants can reference values throughout 2-day journey
- "Leadership compass" metaphor established early
- Values inform decisions in later elements (goal-setting, challenge navigation, action planning)
- Element 3 will explicitly reference back: "Looking at this leadership challenge through your values lens..."

**Integration with Full Journey**:
- Day 1, Session 2: "Remember your values - how do they inform this decision?"
- Day 1, Closing: "What value showed up most for you today?"
- Day 2, Opening: "Which value is calling for attention today?"
- Day 2, Closing: "How will you honor your values as you return to work?"

## üí° STANDALONE USAGE EXAMPLE

### Scenario: 90-Minute Values Workshop (Standalone)

**When Using Outside Journey Context**:

**Adaptations for Standalone**:
1. Add 5-min opening explaining why values matter (not assumed from journey)
2. Extend to 35 minutes total for fuller experience
3. Add 5-min closing integration about taking values forward (since won't reference later)
4. Provide handout with named values to take home

**Structure**:
- Introduction (5 min): Why values matter
- Element as written (35 min): Extended version with more pair sharing
- Closing (5 min): "How will you use this values clarity going forward?"

**Still Effective Standalone Because**:
- Core process is self-contained
- Outcome is immediately useful (know your values)
- Doesn't require what comes before/after
- With minor additions, complete experience

[Annotation: Shows element's flexibility and how to adapt when not part of journey]

## üí° KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS EXAMPLE

**What Makes This Journey Element Strong**:
1. **Clear purpose** - values foundation for journey
2. **Modular structure** - 5 distinct steps
3. **Realistic timing** - tested and refined (25 min)
4. **Integration clarity** - explicit about what builds on this
5. **Flexible placement** - works early journey but adaptable
6. **Standalone capable** - can work outside journey with minor adaptation
7. **Multiple group sizes** - scales from 1-on-1 to 20 people

**Journey Element Design Principles**:
- **Purpose within journey arc** - not just activity, but foundation
- **Clear before/after** - what it builds on, what it prepares for
- **Modular steps** - can compress/extend based on time
- **Integration points** - how journey references this later
- **Standalone flexibility** - works in or out of journey context
- **Practical guidance** - facilitator can run this without guessing

**How to Use This as Your Guide**:
- Identify where element fits in typical journey arc (beginning, middle, end)
- Design steps that are modular (can adjust timing)
- Specify what this element builds on and prepares for
- Show how element integrates throughout journey
- Include standalone adaptation if applicable
- Provide realistic timing based on testing
- Show element in full journey context
- Demonstrate how journey references element repeatedly
