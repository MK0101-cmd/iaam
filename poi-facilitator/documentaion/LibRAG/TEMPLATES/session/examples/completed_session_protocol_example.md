- "What's important for me to know about you and your situation?"

**Transition to Next Phase**:

- "What questions do you have about how we'll work together?"

**Transition to Next Phase**:
"Let's close with a simple practice that honors what's emerged here today."
```

**Phase 5: Closing - Commitment & Closure** (Duration: 5 min)

```

- [x] The Coaching Game (photo cards)

### 3.3 Critical Moments *REQUIRED*
```
**Card selection moment**: Client's intuitive choice reveals more than direct questions. Honor it without over-interpreting.

**Gap exploration**: Discussing what stands between current and desired - this is where real coaching issues surface.

```

## Part 4: Facilitation Guidance

### 4.1 Pre-Session Preparation *REQUIRED*

```
**1 day before**:
- [ ] Confirm appointment via email/text
- [ ] Send brief note about what to expect
- [ ] Review any intake form client completed

**Morning of**:
- [ ] Prepare space (comfortable, private, welcoming)
- [ ] Select 15-20 diverse photo cards
- [ ] Have water/tea available
- [ ] Check lighting and comfort of seating

**30 minutes before**:
- [ ] Center yourself - this is about THEM not you
- [ ] Review client name and any notes
- [ ] Set intention: curiosity, presence, service
```

### 4.2 Facilitator Mindset *REQUIRED*
```
**Beginner's mind**: You don't know this person yet. Be genuinely curious. **Presence over technique**: Your attunement matters more than perfect questions. **Trust the process**: POY works when you trust it and get out of the way. **Not fixing**: You're not here to fix them; you're here to facilitate their own discovery.
```

### 4.3 Opening Script *REQUIRED*
```
"Welcome. I'm so glad you're here. [Pause, eye contact, warmth] Before we dive in, I want to say how I work. My role is to ask questions and create space for you to discover your own answers. I'm not going to tell you what to do - you're the expert on your life. I'm going to introduce you to a methodology that uses images and metaphor to help you see things from fresh perspectives. [Pause] Does that sound okay? [Wait for yes] Great. Let's start with this: What brings you here today?"
```

### 4.4 Facilitation Tips by Phase *REQUIRED*

**Phase 1 (Opening)**: 
```
**Tips**:
- Don't rush contracting - clear agreements prevent problems later
- Listen for both content (what they say) and process (how they say it)

**Watch For**:
- Red flags about fit (unrealistic expectations, not ready for coaching)

**Common Pitfall**:
- Spending too long here - 15 min max or you rush later phases
```

**Phase 2-3 (Card Work)**:
```
**Tips**:
- Trust their card choice completely
- Reflect back what you hear without adding interpretation
- Use their language and metaphors

**Watch For**:
- When to go deeper vs. when to move on
- Emotional emergence - slow down if needed

**Common Pitfall**:
- Over-interpreting cards - let THEM tell you what it means
```

**Phase 4-5 (Integration/Close)**:
```
**Tips**:
- Don't over-plan - trust what emerged
- Make action step small and specific
- Be clear about next steps

**Watch For**:
- Client trying to please you with their action step
- Rushing the closing ritual

**Common Pitfall**:
- Forgetting to schedule next session before they leave
```

### 4.5 Closing Protocol *REQUIRED*
```
"Let's take a moment to close. [Pause] Look at your two cards one more time - where you are and where you're going. [Pause] What wants to happen between now and when we meet next? What's one small step? [Listen, write it down with them] Beautiful. I'll see you [confirm date/time]. Thank you for your trust today."
```

### 4.6 Common Challenges *REQUIRED*

**Challenge 1**:
```
**Situation**: Client intellectualizes and stays in head, doesn't connect emotionally
**Prevention**: Choose cards with emotional resonance, ask feeling questions not just thinking questions
**Response**: "I notice we're talking a lot about what you think. What do you feel when you look at this card?"
```

**Challenge 2**:
```
**Situation**: Client chooses card but says "I don't know why I picked this"
**Prevention**: Normalize that intuitive knowing comes before conscious understanding
**Response**: "That's perfect. You don't need to know why yet. Just tell me what you see in the image. What draws your attention?"
```

**Challenge 3**:
```
**Situation**: Time runs over and you still haven't discussed logistics/next steps
**Prevention**: Set timer at 70 min to ensure 20 min for integration
**Response**: "I want to honor our time and also make sure we close well. Let's focus on the most important piece for next steps."
```

---

## Part 8: Quality Standards

### 8.1 Quality Indicators *REQUIRED*

**Session meets quality standards when**:

- [ ] Cards were used effectively (not rushed, not over-interpreted)
- [ ] Client gained at least one meaningful insight
- [ ] Coaching focus area is clear to both parties
- [ ] Logistics and agreements are clear
- [ ] Next steps are confirmed
- [ ] Session honored time boundaries
- [ ] Coach maintained presence and curiosity throughout
```

### 8.2 Ethical Considerations *REQUIRED*
```
**Informed consent**: Client understands what coaching is (and isn't - not therapy)
**Confidentiality**: Clear boundaries about what stays confidential
**Dual relationships**: Ensure no conflicts of interest
**Scope of practice**: If mental health concerns arise, appropriate referral
**Cultural competence**: Awareness of your own cultural assumptions and client's cultural context
```

### 8.3 Safety Protocols *REQUIRED*
```
**Emotional safety**: If client becomes distressed, slow down, ground them, assess whether they need different support
**Boundaries**: Clear about your role and what you can/can't provide
**Crisis protocol**: Know when/how to refer out if client discloses crisis situation
**Trauma-informed**: Don't push into trauma territory without training; respect client's pacing and boundaries
```

---

## Part 9: Adaptations

### 9.1 Time Adaptations *REQUIRED*
```
**75-min version**: Shorten opening to 10 min, card exploration to 40 min (20 each card), keep integration full at 20 min, brief closing 5 min.

**120-min version**: Extended card work (3 cards: current, obstacle, desired), more spacious pacing, longer integration with detailed action planning.
```

### 9.2 Group Size Adaptations
```
N/A - This protocol is specifically for one-on-one work. For groups, use different protocol.
```

### 9.3 Virtual Delivery
```
**Adaptations**: Use digital card deck shared on screen OR mail physical cards to client beforehand. Ensure they can see cards clearly. Build in extra time for tech hiccups. Use chat for action step writing. Screenshot their two cards and send after session.

**Best practice**: Test tech 10 min before session. Have backup plan if connection fails.
```

### 9.4 Cultural Adaptations
```
**Time orientation**: Some cultures may need more relationship-building before diving into content - extend opening if needed.
**Directness**: Adjust question directness based on cultural comfort with confrontation.
**Cards**: Be aware some images may have different cultural meanings - always ask client what THEY see.
**Contracting**: Some cultures less comfortable with explicit agreements - weave agreements into conversation organically.
```
