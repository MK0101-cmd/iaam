## üí° USAGE EXAMPLE IN SESSION

### Scenario: One-on-One Coaching - Overwhelmed Mother

**Context**: Client is overwhelmed with parenting two teenagers, feeling reactive and lost in chaos

**Facilitator**: "I'd like you to choose a card from these FACES cards. Just go with what draws you."

**Client**: [Browses cards, picks FACES_023] "This one. I don't know why."

**Facilitator**: "What do you see in this face?"

**Client**: "They're watching something. Calmly. Like they're not caught up in it. Just... observing."

**Facilitator**: [Pauses 5 seconds] "And what does that observing feel like to you?"

**Client**: "Peaceful. Like they're not trying to fix anything. They're just... noticing."

**Facilitator**: "Where in your life might you need that - to observe without trying to fix?"

**Client**: [Long pause] "My kids. I'm so caught up in trying to solve everything, managing every crisis. I'm exhausted. What if I could just... witness? Just be present and notice, without having to fix it all?"

**Facilitator**: "What would that look like?"

**Client**: "When my daughter comes home upset, instead of jumping into problem-solving mode, I could just... listen. Observe what she's experiencing. See her without needing her to be different."

**Facilitator**: "How does this face help you do that?"

**Client**: [Looking at card] "It reminds me that observing IS doing something. That witnessing is a gift. I don't have to fix everything. Sometimes being the observer - really seeing them - is enough."

**Why This Works**:
- Card's observer quality mirrors what client needs
- Questions move from description to personal application
- Client discovers insight through projection onto face
- The face becomes anchor for new behavior (observer stance)
- Specific application emerges naturally (daughter interaction)

[Annotation: Full example shows card selection, facilitation, projection, insight, and concrete application]

## üí° ADDITIONAL USAGE EXAMPLES

### Lost Series Application: Finding Self Through Witnessing

**Usage**: Person feeling lost in career transition. "This face witnesses you without judgment. What does it see that you can't see about yourself right now?" Client uses observer face to see their own strengths and patterns from distance.

### Knowing Series Application: Wisdom of Distance

**Usage**: Team stuck in conflict. "What would an observer notice about our dynamic right now?" Use face to invite meta-perspective, seeing patterns the group is too close to notice.

### Givers Series Application: The Gift of Being Seen

**Usage**: Individual exploring relationships. "Who in your life offers you the gift this face offers - truly seeing you, witnessing you without needing you to change?" Identifies the givers in their life.

[Annotation: Shows versatility across all three applicable series]
