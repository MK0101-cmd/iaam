## Part 3: Process Steps

### 3.1 Opening/Introduction *REQUIRED* | Max 500 characters

**What facilitator says/does to begin**:

**Your Input**:
```
"Today we're working with FACES - faces that serve as mirrors. Each of these faces can reflect something about us back to us. You'll choose faces that resonate, and explore what they're showing you. There are no right or wrong choices - whatever draws you is meaningful. [Pause] Take a moment to arrive. [3 breaths together] Let's begin by browsing these faces with curiosity. Just notice which ones catch your attention."
```
[Annotation: 457/500 characters, warm tone, explains mirror metaphor, creates safety]

### 3.2 Main Process Steps (Provide 4-8 steps) *REQUIRED*

**Step 1: Browse and Notice** (Duration: 5 min)

```
**Facilitator Action**:
Invite participants to browse cards silently, noticing which faces draw their attention. "Don't think too much. Trust your gut. Which faces are you drawn to? Which ones make you want to look away?"

**Participant Action**:
Browse cards slowly, notice reactions (attraction, aversion, curiosity)

**Key Questions/Prompts**:
"Which faces call to you? Which ones do you want to avoid?"

**Facilitator Notes**:
Aversion is as meaningful as attraction. Both are projections. Don't let participants dismiss cards they dislike.
```

**Step 2: Select "This Is Me"** (Duration: 7 min)

```
**Facilitator Action**:
"Choose one face that feels like 'this is me right now' - the face that most reflects how you see yourself or feel about yourself today."

**Participant Action**:
Select one card, place in front of them

**Key Questions/Prompts**:
"What is it about this face that feels like you? What does this face know about you?"

**Facilitator Notes**:
This is conscious self-image. Honor whatever they choose, even if it surprises them. Ask about the choice, don't interpret.
```

**Step 3: Select "This Is Who I Want to Be"** (Duration: 7 min)

```
**Facilitator Action**:
"Now choose a face that represents who you want to be, an aspiration, a quality you're growing toward."

**Participant Action**:
Select second card, place next to first

**Key Questions/Prompts**:
"What quality does this face have that you're reaching for? What would it feel like to embody this?"

**Facilitator Notes**:
This reveals values and aspirations. Look for gap between cards 1 and 2 - that's where growth edge lives.
```

**Step 4: Select "This Is My Shadow"** (Duration: 7 min)

```
**Facilitator Action**:
"Now choose a face that shows something you hide, something you don't want others to see, or a quality you judge in yourself or others. This is your shadow face."

**Participant Action**:
Select third card, place completing a triangle

**Key Questions/Prompts**:
"What does this face carry that you try not to show? What does it know about you that you don't usually acknowledge?"

**Facilitator Notes**:
This can feel vulnerable. Create safety. Remind: "Shadow isn't bad - it's hidden. Often our power lives in shadow." Watch for defensive reactions.
```

**Step 5: Explore the Three** (Duration: 10 min)

```
**Facilitator Action**:
"Look at your three faces together. What do they tell you? How do they relate? What patterns do you see?"

**Participant Action**:
Reflect on three cards as whole, journal insights

**Key Questions/Prompts**:
- "What's the relationship between these three faces?"
- "What do they together tell you about where you are right now?"
- "If these faces could speak to each other, what would they say?"
- "What wants to shift or integrate?"

**Facilitator Notes**:
This is integration phase. Listen deeply. Reflect back themes. Help them see patterns they might miss.
```
[Annotation: Complete 5-step process with timing, facilitator actions, participant actions, questions, and notes]

### 3.3 Closing/Integration *REQUIRED* | Max 500 characters

**How to close the process**:

**Your Input**:
```
"Take a final moment with your three faces. [Pause] What's the one insight you're taking with you? [If group: invite brief sharing - one sentence each] These faces have served as mirrors today. What they reflected is your wisdom, not mine. Honor what you've seen. You can photograph your three faces to take with you as reminder. [Closing breath together] Thank you for your courage in looking."
```
[Annotation: 445/500 characters, integration question, optional sharing, closing ritual]

## Part 4: Facilitation Guidance

### 4.1 Facilitator Mindset | Max 400 characters

**Your Input**:
```
**Trust their choices completely**. Whatever face they choose is right. Your job is to ask questions, not interpret. Stay curious, not knowing. Create safety for shadow work - some faces may bring up shame or vulnerability. Your groundedness enables their honesty. Don't rescue them from discomfort, but be present to it. The faces are mirrors; help them see what's reflected.
```
[Annotation: 391/400 characters, emphasizes key facilitator attitudes]

### 4.2 Variations | Max 400 characters

**Your Input**:
```
**Past-Present-Future**: Choose faces for "who I was," "who I am," "who I'm becoming." **Relationship**: Choose faces for "how I see myself," "how others see me," "how I want to be seen." **Team version**: Each person shares one face representing their role in team. **Quick check-in**: Use single face selection: "Choose face that represents your current state."
```
[Annotation: 397/400 characters, 4 practical variations with clear structure]

## Part 5: Integration with FACES System

### 5.1 Series Focus

**This method works particularly well with** (check all):
- [x] Open-minded series (self-discovery requires openness)
- [x] Givers series (seeing self-care needs, giving to self)
- [x] Takers series (what am I taking from others/self?)
- [x] Stormy series (shadow work, emotional truth)
- [x] Calculated series (planning who to be, strategic self-image)
- [x] Lost series (when feeling disconnected from self)
- [x] Knowing series (accessing inner wisdom)
- [x] All series (universal method)

[Annotation: Works with all series, each offers different flavor]

### 5.2 Card Selection Approach

**How participants select cards in this method**:
- [x] Intuitive selection (drawn to a card) - primary approach
- [ ] Random selection (blind draw)
- [ ] Facilitator guided
- [ ] Theme-based selection
- [ ] Series-specific selection
- [ ] Other: Aversion-based (cards they want to avoid)

[Annotation: Intuitive selection essential for mirror work]

## üí° USAGE EXAMPLE IN WORKSHOP

### Scenario: Personal Development Workshop, 6 Participants

**Context**: Day-long workshop on authentic leadership, mid-morning session

**Facilitator**: [After introduction] "Take 5 minutes to browse these faces. Just notice - no thinking yet. Which ones draw you?"

**[5 minutes of silent browsing, participants moving around cards]**

**Facilitator**: "Choose one face that feels like 'this is me right now.' Trust your first instinct."

**[Participants select, some immediately, others deliberating]**

**Participant 1**: [Holds card of serious, intense face] "This one. I'm all business lately."

**Facilitator**: "What does this face know about you?"

**Participant 1**: "That I'm... exhausted from being so serious. This face looks tired."

**[Facilitator nods, doesn't interpret, moves to next selection]**

**Facilitator**: "Now choose a face that represents who you want to be - an aspiration."

**Participant 1**: [Browses, selects laughing, open face] "This one. Someone who can be light."

**Facilitator**: "What's the gap between these two faces for you?"

**Participant 1**: "Between serious and light? Everything. My whole life feels like that gap right now."

**[Process continues through shadow selection]**

**Participant 1**: [Reluctantly selects angry face] "I don't want to choose this one, but... this is my shadow. I'm angry. Under all the serious, professional stuff, I'm just... angry."

**Facilitator**: [After pause] "What does this angry face want you to know?"

**Participant 1**: [Tears] "That I have a right to be angry. That anger isn't unprofessional - it's honest. That maybe if I let myself feel angry, I wouldn't have to be so damn serious all the time."

**[Group witness in supportive silence]**

**Facilitator**: "Look at your three faces together. What do they tell you?"

**Participant 1**: "That I'm holding so tight to 'serious professional' [Card 1] because I'm afraid of my anger [Card 3]. But what I really want is to be light [Card 2], and maybe... maybe I can't get there until I let the anger move through."

**[Other participants work through their own three cards, similar depth emerging]**

**Facilitator**: [Closing] "These faces have served as mirrors. What they showed you is your wisdom. Honor what you saw. You can photograph your faces to take with you."

**[Several participants photograph their three cards]**

**Post-Session**: Multiple participants report the three faces stayed with them, became internal reference points for self-awareness work.

**Why This Works**:
- Three-card structure creates narrative arc (present-aspiration-shadow)
- Mirror metaphor gives permission to project without "making up" meaning
- Shadow card normalized as part of wholeness, not "bad"
- Group witness amplifies individual insight
- Faces become portable reminders of insights
- Facilitator asked questions, didn't interpret

## üí° COMMON CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

### Challenge 1: Participant Can't Choose Shadow Card

**Situation**: "I don't have a shadow. I don't hide anything."

**Solution**: Reframe: "Shadow isn't always negative - it's what's hidden. What quality do you have that you minimize? What do others see in you that you dismiss?" Or: "Which face here annoys you most? That's often shadow - what we judge in others is often what we've disowned in ourselves."

### Challenge 2: Participant Chooses Same Face Three Times

**Situation**: Picks similar expression/energy for all three cards

**Solution**: Acknowledge: "I notice all three faces have similar energy. What might that tell you?" Often indicates: a) Very integrated person, b) Difficulty accessing shadow, or c) Stuck in one mode. Ask: "Is there a face here that's nothing like you? Let's explore that one for shadow."

### Challenge 3: Group Member Shares Interpretation of Another's Cards

**Situation**: "Oh, I think your face means you're..." [interpretation]

**Solution**: Gently interrupt: "Let's let [name] tell us what their faces mean to them. Our projections are about us, not about them." Remind group: "Each person is expert on their own cards."

[Annotation: Three real challenges from testing with specific, actionable solutions]

## üí° CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS

**Self-Focus**: Method is individually focused which aligns with individualist cultures but may feel uncomfortable in collectivist cultures. Adaptation: Add fourth card "This is us/my community" to honor collective identity.

**Shadow Concept**: Not all cultures have concept of psychological shadow. Some see hidden aspects as private, not needing exploration. Honor resistance - don't push shadow work if culturally inappropriate.

**Direct Gaze**: Some faces have direct eye contact; in some cultures this is confrontational. Acknowledge if participants avoid those faces: "Some faces look right at you - that might feel intense. That's okay."

[Annotation: Specific cultural adaptations based on testing with diverse groups]

## üí° KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS EXAMPLE

**What Makes This FACES Working Method Strong**:
1. **Clear three-part structure** - present, aspiration, shadow creates narrative
2. **Mirror metaphor** - gives psychological permission to project meaning
3. **Progressive vulnerability** - starts safe (present self), builds to shadow
4. **Facilitator restraint** - asks questions, doesn't interpret
5. **Integration built-in** - three cards together reveal patterns
6. **Portable tool** - participants can photograph cards as ongoing reminder
7. **Tested extensively** - refined based on 40+ sessions

**FACES Working Method Design Principles**:
- **Structure serves discovery** - three cards isn't arbitrary, it creates arc
- **Safety first** - build trust before shadow work
- **Participant as expert** - they interpret their choices, not facilitator
- **Visual anchors** - faces become ongoing reference points
- **Group witness optional** - works individually or collectively
- **Variations extend utility** - past-present-future, relationship, team

**How to Use This as Your Guide**:
- Create clear card selection structure (how many, what purpose)
- Build vulnerability progressively (easy to difficult)
- Provide exact facilitator language and questions
- Anticipate challenges with specific solutions
- Test timing thoroughly before publishing
- Include multiple variations for different contexts
- Address cultural considerations explicitly
- Show method in full use with real scenario
