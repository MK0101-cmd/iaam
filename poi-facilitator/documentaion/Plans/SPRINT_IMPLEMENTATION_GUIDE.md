## üìÖ Daily Sprint Workflow

### Daily Standup (10 minutes @ 9:00 AM)

**Format**:
```
For each team member (max 3 min each):
1. What did you complete yesterday?
2. What will you work on today?
3. Any blockers or help needed?

For team (final 1-2 min):
- Review sprint burndown
- Address blockers immediately
- Adjust plan if needed
```

**Standup Best Practices**:
- ‚úÖ Start on time, end on time (10 min max)
- ‚úÖ Stand if in person (keeps it short)
- ‚úÖ Focus on work, not status reporting
- ‚úÖ Take detailed discussions offline
- ‚úÖ Update board before standup
- ‚úÖ Identify blockers, don't solve them
- ‚úÖ Record notes in Slack for async team

**Standup Anti-Patterns**:
- ‚ùå Problem-solving during standup
- ‚ùå Detailed technical discussions
- ‚ùå Manager status reports
- ‚ùå Reviewing the entire backlog
- ‚ùå Starting late or running long

### Daily Development Workflow

```
9:00 AM  | Daily Standup
9:15 AM  | Focus work begins
         | - Pull latest code
         | - Pick top priority task
         | - Create feature branch
         |
12:00 PM | Lunch break
         |
1:00 PM  | Afternoon focus work
         | - Continue development
         | - Write tests
         | - Update documentation
         |
3:00 PM  | Code review time
         | - Review teammate PRs
         | - Address review feedback
         |
5:00 PM  | End of day
         | - Push work in progress
         | - Update sprint board
         | - Document tomorrow's plan
```

## üö® Handling Common Sprint Challenges

### Challenge 1: Scope Creep

**Symptoms**:
- New stories added mid-sprint
- Acceptance criteria expanded
- "Just one more thing" requests

**Solutions**:
```markdown
1. Strict Change Control:
   - New requests go to backlog, not current sprint
   - Only Product Owner can change scope
   - Team must agree to any mid-sprint adds

2. Sprint Buffer:
   - Reserve 10-15% capacity for unexpected work
   - Have stretch goals to drop if needed

3. Communication:
   - Remind stakeholders of sprint commitment
   - Offer to prioritize for next sprint
   - Explain cost of context switching
```

---

### Challenge 2: Blocked Tasks

**Symptoms**:
- Tasks waiting on external dependency
- Team member stuck without help
- Progress stalled

**Solutions**:
```markdown
1. Immediate Escalation:
   - Raise in daily standup same day
   - Tag blocker in Slack
   - Alert team lead if critical

2. Workarounds:
   - Find alternative approaches
   - Mock dependencies temporarily
   - Work on parallel tasks

3. Prevention:
   - Identify dependencies in planning
   - Get external commitments upfront
   - Build mocks/stubs early
```

---

### Challenge 3: Underestimation

**Symptoms**:
- Tasks taking 2x estimated time
- Sprint burndown not tracking well
- Team feeling rushed

**Solutions**:
```markdown
1. Re-estimate:
   - Update estimates as you learn
   - Be honest about remaining work
   - Adjust scope if needed

2. Learn & Improve:
   - Track actual vs. estimate
   - Discuss in retrospective
   - Improve estimation over time

3. Communicate Early:
   - Flag issues by mid-sprint
   - Don't wait until review to surprise
   - Adjust sprint goal if necessary
```

---

### Challenge 4: Technical Debt Accumulation

**Symptoms**:
- Development slowing down
- More bugs being introduced
- Code becoming hard to change

**Solutions**:
```markdown
1. Track Explicitly:
   - Log tech debt items as stories
   - Estimate impact and effort
   - Make visible to Product Owner

2. Allocate Time:
   - Reserve 10-20% of sprint for tech debt
   - One "cleanup" story per sprint minimum
   - Don't let it accumulate indefinitely

3. Preventative:
   - Strong Definition of Done
   - Code review standards
   - Refactor as you go
```
